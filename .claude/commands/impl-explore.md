# EXPLORE Phase (Implementation Layer)

You are in the EXPLORE phase of ACDM implementation.

## Prerequisites

- Implementation instructions exist
- Specification exists

## Your Task

Understand the codebase before making any changes.

## Steps

1. **Read Instructions**
   - Find and read implementation instructions
   - Find and read specification
   - Note any questions

2. **Read CLAUDE.md**
   - Understand project structure
   - Note conventions and patterns
   - Check key commands

3. **Explore Relevant Code**
   - Read files mentioned in instructions
   - Map dependencies
   - Identify touch points (files to modify)

4. **Verify Understanding**
   - Does spec make sense?
   - Any gaps or ambiguities?
   - Any conflicts with existing code?

## Rules

- ❌ Do NOT write any code yet
- ❌ Do NOT modify any files
- ✅ Use Plan Mode (read-only) if available
- ✅ Ask questions if unclear
- ✅ Report concerns before proceeding

## Output

Before moving to PLAN:
- [ ] Instructions understood
- [ ] Spec understood
- [ ] Relevant code read
- [ ] Dependencies mapped
- [ ] Questions raised (if any)

## Questions to Answer

1. What files need to be modified?
2. What new files need to be created?
3. Are there any conflicts with existing code?
4. What's unclear in the spec?

## Next Phase

If everything clear → `/impl-plan` to create implementation plan.
If questions → Escalate to human/Desktop.
