# DISCOVER Phase

You are starting the DISCOVER phase of ACDM (AI-Collaborative Development Method).

## Your Task

Help the user explore and understand the problem before any solution work.

## Steps

1. **Clarify the problem**
   - What are we trying to solve?
   - Who has this problem?
   - What's the impact of not solving it?

2. **Gather context**
   - Read relevant files (CLAUDE.md, existing docs)
   - What exists already that we can use?
   - What constraints exist?

3. **Identify pain points**
   - List specific pain points (not solutions)
   - Prioritize by impact

4. **Document**
   - Create or update DISCOVERY_BRIEF.md with:
     - Problem statement
     - Current state analysis
     - Pain points (prioritized)
     - Constraints
     - Open questions

## Rules

- ❌ Do NOT propose solutions yet
- ❌ Do NOT start coding
- ✅ Ask clarifying questions
- ✅ Read existing documentation first
- ✅ Document findings as you go

## Output

When DISCOVER is complete, you should have:
- [ ] Clear problem statement
- [ ] Documented pain points
- [ ] Identified constraints
- [ ] DISCOVERY_BRIEF.md created/updated

## Next Phase

After DISCOVER → `/acdm-shape` to analyze options.
