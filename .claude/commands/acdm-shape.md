# SHAPE Phase

You are in the SHAPE phase of ACDM (AI-Collaborative Development Method).

## Prerequisites

- DISCOVER phase complete
- DISCOVERY_BRIEF.md exists

## Your Task

Generate and analyze solution options without committing to implementation.

## Steps

1. **Review Discovery**
   - Read DISCOVERY_BRIEF.md
   - Understand the problem and constraints

2. **Generate Options**
   - Create 2-4 distinct approaches
   - Each option should be viable
   - Don't bias toward one option yet

3. **Analyze Tradeoffs**
   For each option, document:
   - Pros
   - Cons
   - Effort estimate (low/medium/high)
   - Risk factors

4. **Identify Rabbit Holes**
   - What could take longer than expected?
   - What's unknown?

5. **Define No-Gos**
   - What are we explicitly NOT doing?
   - What's out of scope?

6. **Make Recommendation**
   - Which option do you recommend?
   - Why?

## Rules

- ❌ Do NOT start implementing
- ❌ Do NOT skip options analysis
- ✅ Present tradeoffs honestly
- ✅ Let human make final decision
- ✅ Document assumptions

## Next Phase

After human decides → `/acdm-decide` to document decision and create spec.
