## OVERVIEW AND PURPOSE

Building Block 2 represents the critical transition from content understanding to assessment operationalization. This component transforms the validated learning objectives produced in Building Block 1 into a comprehensive assessment blueprint that guides question generation while maintaining constructive alignment throughout the process.

The assessment design process operates at the intersection of pedagogical theory and practical implementation. Drawing on Biggs and Tang's (2011) framework of constructive alignment, this building block ensures that assessment activities directly measure the learning objectives derived from conducted instruction. The process balances teacher expertise in pedagogical decision-making with systematic frameworks that ensure coverage, balance, and technical feasibility.

Unlike Building Block 1's emphasis on understanding what was taught, Building Block 2 focuses on determining how to assess that learning effectively. This component addresses fundamental assessment design questions: What should students be able to demonstrate? How will their understanding be measured? What balance of cognitive levels is appropriate? How will different question types serve distinct assessment purposes?

The hybrid nature of this building block reflects the dual demands of assessment design. Teachers make pedagogical decisions about assessment purpose, cognitive emphasis, and difficulty distribution based on their understanding of student needs and instructional context. Simultaneously, the systematic framework ensures technical compliance with minimum coverage requirements, valid Bloom's taxonomy application, and feasible question type selection given available platforms and grading resources.

## THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS

### Constructive Alignment in Assessment Design

Assessment design in the Modular QGen framework operates from Biggs and Tang's (2011) principle of constructive alignment, which requires explicit connection between intended learning outcomes, teaching activities, and assessment tasks. Building Block 2 operationalizes this principle by creating a systematic mapping from learning objectives (representing what was taught) to question specifications (defining how learning will be assessed).

Constructive alignment serves multiple pedagogical functions in the assessment design process. It ensures that assessment tasks genuinely measure the cognitive levels specified in learning objectives rather than inadvertently testing at lower levels. It makes assessment criteria transparent to both teachers and students by clearly connecting questions to objectives. It guides the development of feedback that references specific learning objectives, helping students understand not just whether answers are correct but how their performance relates to course goals.

The blueprint produced in this building block functions as a constructive alignment contract. Each question specification explicitly states which learning objective it addresses, at what cognitive level, using which assessment format. This explicit mapping enables systematic validation of alignment before question generation begins, preventing the common pitfall of generating numerous questions that fail to measure intended outcomes.

### Bloom's Taxonomy as Assessment Architecture

Bloom's taxonomy (Anderson & Krathwohl, 2001) provides the cognitive architecture for assessment design in Building Block 2. The framework distinguishes six levels of cognitive processing—Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create—each requiring different question formats and assessment approaches.

The assessment design process uses Bloom's taxonomy not merely as a classification scheme but as a strategic planning tool. Distribution decisions across cognitive levels reflect pedagogical priorities about what types of thinking matter most in a given domain. Foundational courses might emphasize Remember and Understand levels to establish conceptual groundwork. Advanced courses might weight heavily toward Analyze and Evaluate levels that require sophisticated reasoning.

Bloom's taxonomy also guides question type selection. Lower cognitive levels (Remember, Understand) align well with selected-response formats like multiple-choice questions that can efficiently assess whether students possess foundational knowledge. Higher cognitive levels (Apply, Analyze, Evaluate) often require constructed-response formats that allow students to demonstrate reasoning processes. Building Block 2 systematically maps question types to cognitive levels, ensuring that assessment format matches cognitive demand.

*For detailed Bloom's taxonomy level definitions with action verbs and question examples, see bb2e (Stage 4: Bloom's Distribution Planning).*

### Formative and Summative Assessment Functions

Black and Wiliam's (1998) distinction between formative and summative assessment functions fundamentally shapes the assessment design process in Building Block 2. These assessment purposes require different design decisions regarding feedback timing, attempt limits, question difficulty distribution, and point allocation.

Formative assessment serves learning by providing feedback that helps students identify areas requiring additional study. Formative assessments in the Modular QGen framework typically feature immediate feedback after each question, unlimited attempts allowing iterative learning, and difficulty distributions weighted toward accessible questions that build confidence while identifying gaps. The assessment blueprint for formative purposes prioritizes learning support over measurement precision.

Summative assessment measures achievement for evaluation and grading purposes. Summative assessments feature deferred or absent feedback during testing, limited attempts to prevent answer memorization, and balanced difficulty distributions that discriminate across the full range of student performance. The assessment blueprint for summative purposes prioritizes measurement validity and reliability over learning support.

Building Block 2 requires explicit teacher decision about assessment purpose early in the design process because this decision cascades through subsequent choices about question count, difficulty distribution, point allocation, and feedback approach.

*For operational framework and decision-making guidance on formative vs. summative assessment, see bb2c (Stage 2: Assessment Strategy Definition).*

### Question Type Affordances and Constraints

Different question formats offer distinct affordances and constraints for assessing learning. Building Block 2 requires understanding these characteristics to make informed decisions about question type distribution.

Selected-response formats (multiple-choice, true-false, matching) offer efficient automated scoring, consistent evaluation across students, and ability to assess large content domains quickly. However, they constrain students to recognize correct answers rather than generate them, potentially underestimating conceptual understanding. These formats work well for assessing foundational knowledge and conceptual understanding but struggle to measure higher-order reasoning.

Constructed-response formats (fill-in-blank, text area, extended text) require students to generate rather than recognize answers, potentially providing more valid measures of understanding. However, they require manual grading for all but the most constrained responses, limiting scalability. These formats excel at assessing application and analysis but demand significant instructor time.

Interactive formats (inline choice, gap match, hotspot) combine some advantages of both approaches by requiring students to construct responses within structured frameworks. Building Block 2 guides strategic selection of question type mixes that balance assessment validity with practical grading constraints.

## PROCESS ARCHITECTURE

### Entry Points and Prerequisites

Building Block 2 accepts three possible entry conditions, each representing different workflow patterns in the Modular QGen framework:

**Standard Entry (Workflow A: Content-Driven):** Teachers arrive with completed Building Block 1 content analysis including validated learning objectives. This represents the ideal sequential path where assessment design builds directly on content understanding. The learning objectives provide the foundation for all subsequent design decisions.

**Standards-Based Entry (Workflow B: Standards-Driven):** Teachers arrive with predetermined learning objectives from curriculum standards (such as Swedish GY25 requirements) rather than derived from content analysis. In this case, Building Block 2 proceeds with provided objectives but may recommend parallel content analysis to validate that objectives align with actual instruction rather than only planned curriculum.

**Revision Entry (Workflow D: Revision-Driven):** Teachers arrive seeking to improve existing assessments. Building Block 2 begins with gap analysis—systematically comparing existing questions against learning objectives to identify coverage gaps, alignment issues, and distribution imbalances. The process then proceeds to blueprint development addressing identified gaps.

Regardless of entry point, Building Block 2 requires validated learning objectives as its foundation. Without clear, measurable objectives mapped to appropriate cognitive levels, systematic assessment design cannot proceed.

### Process Overview: Seven Connected Stages

Building Block 2 follows a structured seven-stage process that transforms learning objectives into a complete assessment blueprint. Each stage involves dialogue between teacher and AI system, with the teacher making pedagogical decisions and the AI system providing analysis, recommendations, and calculations based on those decisions.

The stages follow a logical progression from broad strategic decisions to specific operational details:

1. **Learning Objective Validation** ensures objectives are assessable and complete
2. **Assessment Strategy Definition** establishes purpose and constraints
3. **Question Target Determination** sets overall scope
4. **Bloom's Distribution Planning** allocates cognitive emphasis
5. **Question Type Mix Planning** selects appropriate formats
6. **Difficulty Distribution Planning** calibrates challenge levels
7. **Blueprint Construction** synthesizes all decisions into operational specifications

This staged approach prevents premature commitment to specific details before foundational decisions are made. Each stage builds on previous decisions while remaining open to revision if later stages reveal problems with earlier choices.
