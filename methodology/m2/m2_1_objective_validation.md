## STAGE 1: LEARNING OBJECTIVE VALIDATION

### Purpose and Process

Stage 1 validates that learning objectives from Building Block 1 are suitable for guiding assessment development. While Building Block 1 produces objectives grounded in content analysis, not all such objectives prove immediately assessable without refinement.

**For Standard Entry (post-Building Block 1):** The AI system presents the validated objectives from Building Block 1 (specifically from bb1g: Stage 5 - Scope & Objectives) organized by Bloom's level, showing the distribution across cognitive levels. The teacher reviews this distribution to ensure it reflects desired assessment priorities. If Building Block 1 emphasized certain content areas that the teacher now recognizes should receive different weight in assessment, objectives may be adjusted or reprioritized at this stage.

**For Standards-Based Entry:** The AI system receives predetermined objectives from curriculum standards and performs two validation checks. First, it verifies that objectives use action verbs consistent with claimed Bloom's levels (e.g., "explain" indicates Understand level, not Remember). Second, it checks for gaps in cognitive level distribution that might indicate missing important learning goals. The teacher reviews these validations and may refine objective wording or Bloom's classifications.

**For Revision Entry:** The AI system analyzes existing assessment questions to infer the implicit learning objectives they address, then presents these inferred objectives for teacher validation. This reverse-engineering process often reveals that existing assessments inadvertently omit important objectives or test at unintended cognitive levels. Teachers may discover that questions claimed to assess "understanding" actually only require recognition memory, indicating need for objective refinement.

### Validation Criteria

Effective learning objectives for assessment purposes must meet several criteria derived from assessment design literature:

**Observable and Measurable:** Each objective must specify observable student performance that can be measured through questions. Objectives using vague language ("appreciate," "be aware of") require refinement to specify concrete demonstrations of learning. For example, "appreciate the complexity of evolutionary processes" becomes "analyze how multiple factors interact in evolutionary scenarios."

**Appropriate Cognitive Level:** The action verb in each objective must accurately reflect the intended cognitive demand. Common problems include objectives claiming higher cognitive levels while describing lower-level tasks, or objectives grouping multiple cognitive levels together inconsistently. Stage 1 validation ensures each objective clearly targets a single Bloom's level.

**Comprehensive Coverage:** The complete set of objectives must cover all essential content identified in Building Block 1 as Tier 1 (essential) and most content identified as Tier 2 (important). Gaps in objective coverage at this stage create systematic gaps in resulting assessments. The AI system checks that all major concepts from content analysis appear in at least one learning objective.

**Achievable Scope:** Each objective must be specific enough to guide focused question development while broad enough to accommodate multiple questions at different difficulty levels. Overly narrow objectives ("list the three types of natural selection") constrain question variety. Overly broad objectives ("understand evolution") provide insufficient guidance for question development.

### Dialogue Pattern: Validation Discussion

The Stage 1 dialogue follows a structured pattern that surfaces potential problems with objectives before proceeding to assessment design:

```
AI System Initial Presentation:

"Based on [Building Block 1 / provided standards / existing assessment], 
I have organized learning objectives across Bloom's taxonomy levels:

REMEMBER (2 objectives, 18%):
- LO1: [action verb] [content]
- LO2: [action verb] [content]

UNDERSTAND (4 objectives, 36%):
- LO3: [action verb] [content]
- LO4: [action verb] [content]
- LO5: [action verb] [content]
- LO6: [action verb] [content]

APPLY (2 objectives, 18%):
- LO7: [action verb] [content]
- LO8: [action verb] [content]

ANALYZE (2 objectives, 18%):
- LO9: [action verb] [content]
- LO10: [action verb] [content]

EVALUATE (1 objective, 9%):
- LO11: [action verb] [content]

This distribution allocates 54% to foundational levels (Remember, Understand) 
and 45% to higher-order levels (Apply, Analyze, Evaluate).

Coverage check against Building Block 1 content tiers:
✅ All Tier 1 (essential) content represented
✅ Most Tier 2 (important) content represented
⚠️  Tier 2 concept [X] has no corresponding objective

Questions for validation:
1. Does this distribution reflect your assessment priorities?
2. Should we adjust the balance between foundational and higher-order objectives?
3. Should we add an objective for [missing Tier 2 concept]?
4. Do any objectives need refinement in scope or cognitive level?"
```

Teachers respond by confirming the distribution or requesting modifications. Common modifications include:

**Cognitive Redistribution:** "I want more emphasis on application. Can we adjust to 40% foundational and 60% higher-order?" The AI system explains implications (fewer questions at Remember/Understand levels, more scenarios required) and adjusts objective distribution accordingly.

**Objective Addition:** "Yes, we should add an objective about [missing concept]." The AI system proposes an objective with appropriate action verb and Bloom's level, then asks for validation before incorporating it.

**Objective Refinement:** "LO5 seems too broad. Can we split it into two more specific objectives?" The AI system proposes a refinement that maintains the same content coverage while providing clearer guidance for question development.

**Coverage Validation:** "Why wasn't [concept from Building Block 1] included?" The AI system explains whether the concept appeared in Tier 3 (enrichment, not assessed) or was inadvertently missed, then proposes addition if needed.

### Stage 1 Checkpoint

Stage 1 concludes when the teacher confirms that learning objectives accurately represent what should be assessed, at appropriate cognitive levels, with comprehensive coverage of essential content. The AI system documents this confirmation:

```
Learning Objective Validation: COMPLETE

Final objective set:
- [N] total objectives across [N] cognitive levels
- [N] Remember objectives (X%)
- [N] Understand objectives (X%)
- [N] Apply objectives (X%)
- [N] Analyze objectives (X%)
- [N] Evaluate objectives (X%)

Coverage validation:
✅ All Tier 1 (essential) content represented in objectives
✅ [X%] of Tier 2 (important) content represented in objectives
✅ Cognitive distribution reflects stated assessment priorities

These objectives will guide all subsequent assessment design decisions.

Only after explicit teacher confirmation does the process advance to Stage 2.

## STAGE 1 COMPLETION CHECKPOINT

**This stage is now complete.**

### Required Action Before Proceeding

1. **STOP HERE** - Do not proceed to Stage 2 automatically
2. **Present** the validated learning objectives to teacher
3. **WAIT** for teacher to explicitly approve the objective set
4. **Next stage requires:** bb2c (Stage 2: Assessment Strategy Definition)

### Teacher Must Explicitly Confirm

The teacher must explicitly say one of the following:
- "Proceed to Stage 2"
- "Start Stage 2"
- "Continue to assessment strategy definition"
- "Yes, let's define the assessment strategy"

### DO NOT

- ❌ Start Stage 2 dialogue without teacher approval
- ❌ Proceed without bb2c (Stage2_Strategy_Definition.md) loaded
- ❌ Improvise assessment strategy recommendations
- ❌ Skip the approval checkpoint

### What Happens Next

After teacher approval, Stage 2 will determine:
- Assessment type (formative, summative, or hybrid)
- Primary purpose and usage context
- Practical constraints (time, grading, platform, enrollment)
- Configuration defaults based on purpose

**Status:** Stage 1 complete, awaiting teacher approval to proceed to Stage 2
