# BUILDING BLOCK 2i: FACILITATION BEST PRACTICES

**Component:** Building Block 2i  
**Framework:** Modular Question Generation System  
**Purpose:** Cross-cutting guidance for effective assessment design facilitation

---

## OVERVIEW

Building Block 2i provides cross-cutting guidance for facilitating effective assessment design dialogue between teachers and AI systems. Unlike stage-specific files (bb2b-bb2h) that focus on particular design decisions, this document addresses facilitation patterns, common pitfalls, and best practices that apply across the entire Building Block 2 process.

Effective facilitation requires balancing multiple concerns: maintaining teacher pedagogical authority while providing systematic structure, presenting sufficient options without overwhelming, and ensuring decisions are both theoretically sound and practically feasible.

---

## FOR AI SYSTEMS: FACILITATION PRINCIPLES

### Principle 1: Teacher as Decision-Maker

**Core Requirement:** The AI system facilitates but does not decide. All strategic assessment decisions rest with the teacher based on their pedagogical judgment and contextual knowledge.

**Implementation:**
- Present options with analysis, not mandates
- Use language like "I recommend..." not "You should..."
- Always ask for teacher approval before proceeding
- Accept teacher decisions even when they differ from recommendations
- Document teacher's rationale for decisions

**Example - Good:**
```
"Based on formative purpose, I recommend 45% Easy, 40% Medium, 15% Hard.
This distribution builds confidence while identifying gaps.

Does this match your assessment goals, or would you prefer different emphasis?"
```

**Example - Poor:**
```
"For formative assessment, you need 45% Easy questions.
Proceeding with this distribution."
```

### Principle 2: Progressive Disclosure

**Core Requirement:** Introduce complexity gradually. Don't overwhelm teachers with all considerations simultaneously.

**Implementation:**
- Present one decision dimension at a time (Stage 1 → 2 → 3...)
- Start with high-level decisions, then detail
- Explain implications after decisions, not before (unless asked)
- Offer "deep dive" options for teachers wanting more detail

**Example - Stage Flow:**
```
Stage 3: "How many total questions?" [High level]
Stage 4: "How do those questions distribute across cognitive levels?" [Next level]
Stage 5: "What question formats implement those cognitive levels?" [Detail]
```

**Not:** "How many questions of each type at each cognitive level and difficulty?" [Everything at once]

### Principle 3: Validation Before Proceeding

**Core Requirement:** Validate that each decision is sound before building on it.

**Implementation:**
- Run automated validation checks at each stage
- Surface potential problems immediately
- Offer solutions, not just problems
- Don't proceed to next stage with unresolved issues

**Validation Cycle:**
```
1. Teacher makes decision
2. AI validates decision
3. If issues found:
   - Explain problem clearly
   - Offer specific solutions
   - Get teacher's preferred fix
   - Re-validate
4. Only when validation passes → proceed to next stage
```

### Principle 4: Make Rationale Visible

**Core Requirement:** Help teachers understand WHY recommendations are made, enabling informed judgment rather than blind trust.

**Implementation:**
- Always explain reasoning behind recommendations
- Connect recommendations to assessment theory when relevant
- Show how decisions cascade (e.g., purpose → feedback timing)
- Reference specific frameworks (Biggs, Black & Wiliam, etc.)

**Example - Transparent Rationale:**
```
"I recommend 4-6 questions per objective for summative assessment.

Rationale:
- Single questions insufficient to distinguish understanding from guessing
- 2-3 questions adequate for formative but less reliable for grading
- 4-6 questions provide robust evidence for evaluative decisions
- Based on assessment design literature (Black & Wiliam, 1998)

Your summative context suggests the robust range."
```

### Principle 5: Maintain Context Awareness

**Core Requirement:** Remember and reference previous stages' decisions throughout the process.

**Implementation:**
- Reference earlier decisions when relevant
- Show how current stage builds on previous stages
- Validate consistency across stages
- Update understanding as new information emerges

**Example - Context Awareness:**
```
"For Stage 5 question type mix:

Based on your Stage 2 decisions:
- Formative purpose → suggests immediate feedback formats
- Limited grading time → suggests auto-graded emphasis
- 45-minute time constraint → suggests efficient formats

And Stage 4 distribution:
- 40% Remember/Understand → efficient selected-response works well
- 35% Apply → mix of selected and constructed-response
- 25% Analyze/Evaluate → needs some constructed-response

Recommended mix: 70% auto-graded, 30% manual-graded"
```

### Principle 6: Graceful Revision Handling

**Core Requirement:** Support iterative refinement without penalty. Teachers should feel free to reconsider earlier decisions.

**Implementation:**
- Accept requests to revisit previous stages
- Explain cascade effects of changes clearly
- Regenerate affected specifications automatically
- Don't make revision feel like "going backwards"

**Example - Revision Support:**
```
Teacher: "Actually, I want to change the difficulty distribution from Stage 6."

AI: "No problem. Let's revisit Stage 6 difficulty distribution.

Current distribution: 30% Easy, 50% Medium, 20% Hard

What adjustment would you like to make?

Note: Changing difficulty distribution will require updating the Question 
Specification Table, but all other decisions remain valid."
```

### Principle 7: Explicit Stage Gates

**Core Requirement:** Never proceed between stages without explicit teacher approval.

**Implementation:**
- End each stage with clear checkpoint
- Wait for explicit "proceed" confirmation
- Don't assume approval from general conversation
- Make STOP requirement unmistakable

**Stage Gate Template:**
```
---

## STAGE [N] COMPLETION CHECKPOINT

**This stage is now complete.**

1. **STOP HERE** - Do not proceed automatically
2. **Present** [stage output] to teacher
3. **WAIT** for explicit approval
4. **Next stage requires:** [next file]

Teacher must explicitly say: "Proceed to Stage [N+1]" or similar.

DO NOT start next stage without this confirmation.
```

---

## FOR TEACHERS: EFFECTIVE PARTICIPATION

### Guideline 1: Understand the Process Architecture

**Why This Matters:** Knowing where you are in the process helps you make informed decisions.

**Key Understanding:**
- Building Block 2 has 7 stages, each building on the previous
- Early stages (1-3) are strategic, later stages (4-6) are operational
- Stage 7 synthesizes everything into final blueprint
- You can revise earlier decisions if needed

**What This Means:**
- Don't worry about getting Stage 1 "perfect" - you can adjust later
- Strategic decisions (purpose, constraints) matter more than tactical details
- The process ensures nothing is forgotten or overlooked

### Guideline 2: Articulate Your Pedagogical Goals

**Why This Matters:** AI recommendations are based on what you want to achieve. Clear goals enable better recommendations.

**Be Specific About:**
- What do you want students to demonstrate?
- How will this assessment be used?
- What are your priorities (building confidence vs. discriminating performance)?
- What constraints are non-negotiable vs. flexible?

**Example - Clear Goal Articulation:**
```
"This is formative practice before the final exam. I want students to:
- Test their knowledge without high pressure
- Identify specific gaps they should study
- Build confidence on foundational material
- Preview the harder questions they'll face on final

Grading time is very limited - this needs to be auto-graded."
```

**Not:** "I need a quiz for next week."

### Guideline 3: Trust Your Judgment on Pedagogical Decisions

**Why This Matters:** You know your students, content, and context better than any AI system.

**When to Override AI Recommendations:**
- Your students are systematically different from typical patterns
- Your content has unique characteristics
- Your institutional context has special requirements
- Your professional judgment differs from general recommendations

**What Good Override Looks Like:**
```
AI: "I recommend 60% higher-order questions for summative assessment."

Teacher: "Actually, let's do 40% higher-order. This is early in the course,
and students are still building foundations. I'd rather assess foundational
understanding thoroughly now, with more higher-order assessment later."

AI: "Understood. Adjusting to 40% higher-order, 60% foundational..."
```

### Guideline 4: Ask Questions When Uncertain

**Why This Matters:** Assessment design involves technical considerations. Better to clarify than make uninformed decisions.

**Good Questions to Ask:**
- "What does [term] mean in this context?"
- "Why are you recommending [X]?"
- "What happens if I choose [alternative]?"
- "Can you show me what this would look like in practice?"
- "What are the trade-offs between these options?"

**The AI System Should:**
- Explain clearly without jargon
- Provide concrete examples
- Show implications of different choices
- Not make you feel inadequate for asking

### Guideline 5: Consider Practical Constraints Realistically

**Why This Matters:** Beautiful assessment designs fail if not practically feasible.

**Be Honest About:**
- How much grading time you actually have
- When the assessment must be ready
- What your LMS platform can really do
- How much assessment time students can handle

**Reality Check Questions:**
```
"If I have 50 students and 10 short-answer questions requiring manual grading:
- 10 questions × 3 minutes/question × 50 students = 1,500 minutes = 25 hours
- Do I actually have 25 hours for grading?"

If no → Choose different question type distribution
If yes → Confirm it's worth the pedagogical benefits
```

### Guideline 6: Think About Students' Assessment Experience

**Why This Matters:** Assessment design decisions create specific student experiences.

**Consider Student Perspective:**
- **Too many easy questions:** Students may feel under-challenged or that assessment doesn't reflect course rigor
- **Too many hard questions:** Students may feel discouraged or that assessment is unfair
- **All same format:** Students may tune out or miss opportunities to show understanding differently
- **Unclear expectations:** Students may underperform despite understanding content

**Balance:**
- Accessibility (students can demonstrate what they know)
- Challenge (assessment discriminates performance appropriately)
- Fairness (all students have opportunity to succeed)
- Validity (assessment actually measures intended learning)

### Guideline 7: Use the Blueprint as a Living Document

**Why This Matters:** Assessment design should improve over time based on evidence.

**After Assessment Administration:**
- Review actual performance vs. expected patterns
- Note which questions worked well vs. poorly
- Identify unexpected difficulty or ambiguity
- Document what to change for next iteration

**Blueprint Evolution:**
```
Version 1.0: Initial design based on best planning
Version 1.1: Adjusted after first administration
  - Increased Remember questions (students lacked foundations)
  - Reduced hard difficulty (calibration was too strict)
  - Added more short-answer (MC didn't capture reasoning well)
Version 1.2: Further refinements after second administration
  [etc.]
```

## COMMON PITFALLS AND SOLUTIONS

### Pitfall 1: Skipping Stage Gates

**Problem:** Teacher says "yes let's continue" as general conversation, AI interprets as approval to proceed through multiple stages automatically.

**Why It Happens:**
- Conversational flow feels natural to continue
- Stage gates feel like interruptions
- Desire to "get through" the process quickly

**Solution:**
- AI must distinguish between conversational acknowledgment and explicit approval
- Require specific approval language: "proceed to Stage X" or "start Stage X"
- Teacher should explicitly say "STOP" or "WAIT" if AI proceeds prematurely

**Example:**
```
Teacher: "Yes, that distribution looks good."

AI Response (GOOD):
"Excellent. Stage 4 (Bloom's Distribution) is now complete.

Ready to proceed to Stage 5 (Question Type Mix), or would you like to 
review anything first?"

AI Response (BAD):
"Great! Proceeding to Stage 5 question type planning...
[starts Stage 5 without explicit approval]"
```

### Pitfall 2: Over-Committing to Initial Decisions

**Problem:** Teacher feels locked into early decisions even when later stages reveal problems.

**Why It Happens:**
- Perception that revision means "going backwards"
- Concern about wasting time already spent
- Uncertainty about whether revision is allowed

**Solution:**
- AI should normalize revision as part of design process
- Explicitly offer revision when cascade effects create problems
- Make revision feel like refinement, not failure

**Example:**
```
Stage 6 reveals problem:

AI: "The difficulty distribution creates a challenge:
With 60% hard questions and limited time, students may not complete assessment.

Options:
A) Reduce hard percentage to 30% (easier to complete)
B) Extend assessment time from 45 to 60 minutes
C) Return to Stage 3 and reduce total question count

This isn't a problem with your earlier decisions - difficulty implications 
weren't visible until we reached Stage 6. Which approach would you prefer?"
```

### Pitfall 3: Overwhelming with Options

**Problem:** AI presents so many options that teacher can't effectively choose.

**Why It Happens:**
- Desire to show all possibilities
- Attempt to be comprehensive
- Uncertainty about teacher's preference

**Solution:**
- Present 2-3 recommended options with clear trade-offs
- Offer "see more options" for teachers wanting additional choices
- Use decision frameworks to narrow options systematically

**Example:**
```
GOOD (Focused):
"Two main approaches for difficulty distribution:

A) Accessible (50% Easy): Builds confidence, less discriminating
B) Balanced (30% Easy): Moderate challenge, good discrimination

Which approach fits your assessment goals?"

POOR (Overwhelming):
"Here are 8 possible difficulty distributions:
1) 50% Easy, 30% Medium, 20% Hard
2) 45% Easy, 35% Medium, 20% Hard
3) 40% Easy, 40% Medium, 20% Hard
4) 35% Easy, 45% Medium, 20% Hard
5) 30% Easy, 50% Medium, 20% Hard
6) 30% Easy, 45% Medium, 25% Hard
7) 25% Easy, 50% Medium, 25% Hard
8) 20% Easy, 50% Medium, 30% Hard
Which do you prefer?"
```

### Pitfall 4: Ignoring Practical Constraints

**Problem:** Design produces beautiful but impractical assessment (e.g., 4 hours grading per student).

**Why It Happens:**
- Focus on pedagogical ideals over practical reality
- Optimistic estimation of available resources
- Incomplete consideration of cascade effects

**Solution:**
- Validate practical feasibility at every stage
- Surface constraint violations immediately
- Force explicit choice between ideal and feasible

**Example:**
```
Stage 5 constraint violation:

AI: "⚠️  Practical Constraint Alert:

Your question type selection includes:
- 15 short answer questions (3 min grading each)
- 5 essay questions (10 min grading each)

For 60 students:
- Short answer: 15 × 3 min × 60 students = 2,700 min = 45 hours
- Essay: 5 × 10 min × 60 students = 3,000 min = 50 hours
- Total: 95 hours of manual grading

You indicated 'limited' grading time available in Stage 2.

This is not feasible. Options:
A) Reduce constructed-response to 5 short answer, 1 essay (15 hours total)
B) Increase available grading time commitment
C) Reduce class size (not realistic)

Which adjustment would you like to make?"
```

### Pitfall 5: Misalignment Between Purpose and Design

**Problem:** Assessment design doesn't match stated purpose (e.g., formative with summative features).

**Why It Happens:**
- Unclear understanding of formative vs. summative
- Conflicting goals (want both practice and grading)
- Institutional requirements vs. pedagogical preferences

**Solution:**
- Explicitly validate alignment at Stage 7
- Surface contradictions clearly
- Help teacher resolve with hybrid approach if needed

**Example:**
```
Stage 7 validation finds misalignment:

AI: "⚠️  Purpose-Design Alignment Issue:

Stage 2 Purpose: Formative (practice and learning support)

Current Design:
- Single attempt (summative pattern)
- No immediate feedback (summative pattern)
- High percentage hard questions (summative pattern)

This design doesn't support formative learning effectively.

Options:
A) Change purpose to summative (design matches this better)
B) Revise design for formative:
   - Allow unlimited attempts
   - Enable immediate feedback
   - Increase accessible questions
C) Create hybrid with explicit trade-offs

Which approach aligns with your actual goals?"
```

### Pitfall 6: Inadequate Objective Coverage

**Problem:** Some learning objectives receive insufficient assessment.

**Why It Happens:**
- Focus on interesting content over comprehensive coverage
- Time pressure to limit question count
- Assumption that some objectives are "less important"

**Solution:**
- Validate minimum coverage for all objectives in Stage 3
- Surface coverage gaps immediately
- Force explicit decision about partial coverage

**Example:**
```
Stage 3 coverage validation:

AI: "⚠️  Coverage Issue Detected:

40 questions for 15 objectives:
- Average coverage: 2.7 questions/objective

3 objectives receive only 1 question:
- LO-07: Apply [procedure X] (1 question)
- LO-11: Analyze [concept Y] (1 question)
- LO-14: Evaluate [position Z] (1 question)

Single-question assessment insufficient for reliable measurement.

Options:
A) Increase to 45 questions (3 questions minimum per objective)
B) Combine some objectives to reduce total
C) Accept that LO-07, LO-11, LO-14 receive minimal assessment

Which approach do you prefer?"
```

### Pitfall 7: Unrealistic Bloom's Distribution

**Problem:** Distribution doesn't match content characteristics or student readiness.

**Why It Happens:**
- Desire for higher-order thinking without foundation
- Misunderstanding of what cognitive levels require
- Pressure to "look rigorous" with high percentages

**Solution:**
- Validate that content supports intended distribution
- Check that students have prerequisites for higher-order thinking
- Align distribution with course position and student development

**Example:**
```
Stage 4 validation finds problem:

AI: "⚠️  Distribution Concern:

Proposed distribution: 80% Analyze/Evaluate, 20% Remember/Understand

Potential issues:
1. Students early in topic (Stage 2 context) may lack foundation for 80% higher-order
2. Content is primarily factual/conceptual (BB1 analysis) - may not naturally support 80% analysis
3. Remember/Understand objectives (from Stage 1) represent 50% of objectives but only 20% of questions

Recommendation: More balanced distribution (40-50% higher-order) better matches context.

Alternative: If truly appropriate for advanced students with strong foundations,
please confirm this is intentional.

Proceed with 80% higher-order, or adjust to recommended balance?"
```

## BEST PRACTICES FOR PRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE

### For AI Systems

**Do:**
- Ask one clear question at a time
- Present options with trade-offs explicitly stated
- Validate after every decision
- Make stage transitions obvious
- Document all decisions with rationale
- Surface problems as soon as detected
- Offer solutions, not just problem identification

**Don't:**
- Present 5+ options simultaneously
- Use jargon without explanation
- Assume teacher knowledge of assessment theory
- Proceed without explicit approval
- Hide validation failures
- Make decisions on teacher's behalf
- Create false urgency to "move forward"

### For Teachers

**Do:**
- Be explicit about your goals and constraints
- Ask questions when uncertain
- Override recommendations when your context differs
- Request revision when needed
- Think about student experience
- Consider long-term use and iteration

**Don't:**
- Accept recommendations without understanding rationale
- Feel pressured to proceed quickly
- Assume AI knows your context better than you
- Ignore practical constraint warnings
- Design for ideal rather than reality
- Commit to decisions you're uncertain about

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: Teacher Wants to Skip Stages

**Teacher:** "Can't we just decide everything at once? This feels like a lot of steps."

**AI Response:**
```
"I understand the process feels detailed. The staged approach serves several purposes:

1. Prevents premature decisions: Some decisions depend on earlier decisions
   (e.g., question types depend on cognitive distribution)

2. Manages complexity: 7 interconnected decisions at once is overwhelming

3. Enables validation: Each stage validates before proceeding

4. Supports revision: Can adjust one stage without redoing everything

We can move efficiently through stages (30-45 minutes total), but skipping
stages risks inconsistent or problematic designs requiring complete rework.

Would you like to proceed through stages systematically, or shall I explain
why specific stages matter?"
```

### Scenario 2: Teacher Disagrees with All Recommendations

**Teacher:** "None of your recommendations match what I want to do."

**AI Response:**
```
"Thank you for that feedback - it indicates your assessment context has 
specific characteristics my general recommendations don't capture.

Let's take a different approach:

Instead of me recommending and you adjusting, please describe your ideal
assessment design:
- What would the assessment look like?
- How would students experience it?
- What decisions have you already made?

I'll help structure those ideas into a systematic blueprint rather than
trying to fit a standard template."
```

### Scenario 3: Validation Keeps Failing

**Repeated validation failures across stages.**

**AI Response:**
```
"We're encountering recurring validation issues. This suggests our design
decisions may be fundamentally incompatible with constraints.

Let's step back and examine core tensions:

Stage 2 constraints:
- [constraint 1]
- [constraint 2]
- [constraint 3]

Design decisions creating problems:
- [decision 1] conflicts with [constraint]
- [decision 2] conflicts with [constraint]

Options:
A) Relax one or more constraints (if possible)
B) Reconsider design approach fundamentally
C) Accept a simplified assessment within constraints

Which constraints are negotiable vs. absolute?"
```

### Scenario 4: Teacher Wants Features LMS Can't Support

**Teacher:** "I want [feature] that platform doesn't support."

**AI Response:**
```
"I understand [feature] would be valuable. Unfortunately, [Platform] doesn't
currently support this capability.

Alternatives that might serve similar purposes:
1. [Alternative 1] using [available feature]
2. [Alternative 2] with [workaround]
3. [Alternative 3] accepting [limitation]

Or you could:
- Request feature from LMS vendor
- Export questions for use in different platform
- Implement outside LMS using other tools

Which approach would you like to explore?"
```
