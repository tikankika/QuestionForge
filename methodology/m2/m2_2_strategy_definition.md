## STAGE 2: ASSESSMENT STRATEGY DEFINITION

### Purpose and Scope

Stage 2 establishes the fundamental assessment purpose and practical constraints that shape all subsequent design decisions. This stage addresses Black and Wiliam's (1998) distinction between formative and summative assessment by requiring explicit teacher articulation of assessment goals and usage context.

Assessment strategy decisions cascade through remaining design stages. The choice between formative and summative purposes directly influences appropriate feedback timing (immediate or deferred), suitable attempt limits (unlimited or restricted), optimal difficulty distribution (confidence-building or discriminating), and question point allocation (uniform or variable). Stage 2 makes these cascading implications explicit so teachers understand how strategic choices constrain operational decisions.

### Formative vs. Summative Assessment Purpose

The AI system presents the formative-summative distinction not as a binary choice but as a continuum with clear prototypes at each end and hybrid possibilities between:

```
Assessment Purpose Framework:

FORMATIVE (Practice and Learning):

Primary goal: Help students identify gaps and improve understanding
Usage context: Self-assessment, practice tests, diagnostic checks
Feedback approach: Immediate, explanatory feedback after each question
Attempt policy: Unlimited attempts to support iterative learning
Difficulty balance: More accessible questions to build confidence
Point value: Often ungraded or low-stakes points
Typical features:
- Correct answer shown immediately
- Explanation of why answers are correct/incorrect
- Hints or guidance provided
- Progress tracking emphasized over performance evaluation

When appropriate:
- Students preparing for summative exams
- Early in instructional units (diagnostic)
- When learning support is primary goal
- When stakes are low

SUMMATIVE (Evaluation and Grading):

Primary goal: Measure achievement level for evaluation purposes
Usage context: Final exams, unit tests, graded assessments
Feedback approach: Deferred or absent during test
Attempt policy: Single attempt or very limited attempts
Difficulty balance: Full range to discriminate performance levels
Point value: Significant contribution to course grade
Typical features:
- Answers not revealed during test
- Feedback delayed until after grading
- No hints or assistance
- Accurate measurement emphasized over learning support

When appropriate:
- End-of-unit evaluations
- Final examinations
- When formal grades required
- When comparing student performance needed

HYBRID Approaches:

Some assessments combine elements from both purposes. Common hybrids:
- "Take-home exam": Summative stakes with formative resources
- "Graded practice": Formative format with minor grade weight
- "Test then review": Summative attempt followed by formative feedback

Each hybrid requires explicit decisions about which features to emphasize.
```

The teacher selects assessment purpose from these options, which the AI system then uses to generate appropriate default recommendations for subsequent stages while noting that all recommendations can be adjusted based on specific context.

### Practical Constraints and Context

Beyond assessment purpose, Stage 2 identifies practical constraints that influence feasible assessment designs:

**Time Available:** How much class time or student time is available for assessment? This constraint directly limits question count and type variety. A 30-minute in-class quiz might accommodate 20-25 questions using selected-response formats, but only 3-5 questions if using extended-response formats requiring substantial writing.

**Student Preparation Level:** How well prepared are students for assessment at planned difficulty levels? Students early in their study of a topic need more scaffolding and accessible questions to avoid discouragement. Advanced students benefit from challenging questions that require sophisticated reasoning.

**Platform Capabilities:** What question types does the learning management system support? Technical constraints may preclude certain interactive formats (hotspot, gap match) or limit question metadata tracking. The AI system should note if desired assessment features exceed platform capabilities.

**Grading Resources:** How much instructor time is available for manual grading? This constraint fundamentally shapes appropriate question type distribution. Formative assessments designed for frequent administration typically emphasize auto-graded formats to reduce instructor burden. Summative assessments might justify manual grading time for constructed-response questions that provide richer assessment data.

**Student Population Size:** How many students will take the assessment? Large enrollments favor automated grading to maintain feasibility. Small enrollments might allow more constructed-response questions that provide detailed feedback about reasoning processes.

The AI system documents these constraints explicitly to ensure subsequent design decisions remain realistic:

```
Assessment Context Documentation:

Purpose: [Formative / Summative / Hybrid]
Rationale: [Teacher's explanation]

Practical Constraints:
- Time available: [X] minutes
- Student preparation level: [early/mid/advanced] in topic
- Platform: [LMS name] with [specific capabilities]
- Grading resources: [limited/moderate/extensive] instructor time
- Enrollment: [N] students

These constraints will guide question count, type mix, and difficulty decisions 
in subsequent stages.

```

### Stage 2 Checkpoint

Stage 2 concludes with documented assessment strategy that establishes the foundation for all subsequent design decisions. This checkpoint ensures clarity about fundamental purpose before proceeding to operational details:

```
Assessment Strategy: DEFINED

Assessment Type: [Formative / Summative / Hybrid]

Configuration Defaults Based on Purpose:
- Feedback timing: [immediate / deferred / none]
- Attempt policy: [unlimited / limited to N / single attempt]
- Difficulty emphasis: [accessible / balanced / challenging]
- Point approach: [uniform / weighted by difficulty]

Documented Constraints:
- Time available: [X] minutes
- Student level: [early/mid/advanced] in topic
- Platform: [LMS] with [capabilities]
- Grading resources: [limited/moderate/extensive]
- Enrollment: [N] students

These strategic decisions will guide question count, distribution, and type 
selection in subsequent stages. All defaults may be adjusted based on specific 
needs.

Only with explicit confirmation does Building Block 2 advance to determining specific question quantities and distributions.

## STAGE 2 COMPLETION CHECKPOINT

**This stage is now complete.**

### Required Action Before Proceeding

1. **STOP HERE** - Do not proceed to Stage 3 automatically
2. **Present** the Assessment Strategy documentation to teacher
3. **WAIT** for teacher to explicitly approve the strategy and constraints
4. **Next stage requires:** bb2d (Stage 3: Question Target Determination)

### Teacher Must Explicitly Confirm

The teacher must explicitly say one of the following:
- "Proceed to Stage 3"
- "Start Stage 3"
- "Continue to question target determination"
- "Yes, let's determine question counts"

### DO NOT

- ❌ Start Stage 3 dialogue without teacher approval
- ❌ Proceed without bb2d (Stage3_Question_Target.md) loaded
- ❌ Improvise question count recommendations
- ❌ Skip the approval checkpoint

### What Happens Next

After teacher approval, Stage 3 will determine:
- Total number of questions for the assessment
- Coverage-based minimum calculations
- Time-based feasibility validation
- Question distribution across learning objectives

**Status:** Stage 2 complete, awaiting teacher approval to proceed to Stage 3
