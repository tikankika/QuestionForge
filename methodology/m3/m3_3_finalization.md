## STAGE 4C PROCESS

### Step 1: Question Format Selection

**For Each Question, AI Proposes Format:**

**Format Options:**
- Multiple Choice (single correct answer)
- Multiple Response (multiple correct answers)
- Short Answer (brief constructed response)
- Essay (extended constructed response)
- True/False
- Matching
- Fill-in-the-blank

**Selection Criteria:**
```
AI: "Question 23 on 'economic value of ecosystem services'
     
     Format options:
     A) Multiple Choice - test recognition of correct valuation
     B) Short Answer - require students to calculate
     C) Essay - explain valuation process in depth
     
     Recommendation: Multiple Choice
     Reason: Objective assessment of concept understanding,
             efficient grading, clear right/wrong answer"
```

**Teacher Decision:**
- Approve AI recommendation
- Request different format
- Specify format requirements

### Step 2: Answer Option Development

**For Selected-Response Questions:**

**AI Creates:**
- Correct answer(s)
- Plausible distractors
- Balanced option length
- Parallel grammatical structure

**Distractor Development:**
```
AI: "Question 23: Economic value of wetland ecosystem services
     
     Correct Answer:
     A) Cost of artificial water purification systems
        that would replace wetland filtration
     
     Distractors (plausible alternatives):
     B) Annual tourism revenue from wetland areas
        [too low, different service category]
     C) Total property value within 5km of wetland
        [too high, indirect benefit]
     D) Carbon storage value of wetland biomass
        [correct concept, different service type]
     
     Rationale: Each distractor represents common 
     misconception or related but incorrect valuation"
```

**Teacher Review:**
- Distractors plausible?
- Represent actual misconceptions?
- Similar length and format?
- No obvious giveaways?

### Step 3: Rubric Development (Constructed-Response)

**For Essay/Short Answer Questions:**

**AI Creates Scoring Rubric:**
```
AI: "Question 18: 'Explain how wetlands provide 
     flood control services' (Short Answer, 4 points)
     
     RUBRIC:
     4 points - Complete answer including:
       • Water storage capacity (1 pt)
       • Slowed water flow through vegetation (1 pt)
       • Gradual release mechanism (1 pt)
       • Specific example or quantification (1 pt)
     
     3 points - Includes 3 of 4 elements
     
     2 points - Includes 2 of 4 elements OR
                describes mechanism without specifics
     
     1 point - Mentions flood control but lacks
               mechanism explanation
     
     0 points - Incorrect or no answer
     
     Example 4-point answer:
     'Wetlands act like natural sponges, storing large
      volumes of water during floods. The dense vegetation
      slows water flow, preventing downstream flooding.
      Water is then gradually released over time. For
      example, the Mississippi Delta wetlands can store
      millions of gallons, reducing flood peaks by 20-30%.'"
```

**Teacher Review:**
- Criteria clear and complete?
- Point allocation appropriate?
- Examples helpful?
- Scorable consistently?

### Step 4: Feedback Development

**AI Creates Pedagogical Feedback:**

**For Selected-Response:**
```
AI: "Question 23 Feedback:
     
     [If A selected - CORRECT]:
     'Correct! Replacement cost is a standard method for
      valuing ecosystem services. The cost of building and
      operating water treatment facilities to replace wetland
      filtration provides a tangible economic value. This
      approach is widely used in environmental economics.'
     
     [If B selected]:
     'Tourism revenue is an economic benefit from wetlands,
      but it represents recreational/cultural services, not
      the water purification service being valued. Consider
      what would need to be built to replace the purification
      function specifically.'
     
     [If C selected]:
     'While wetlands can increase nearby property values,
      this is an indirect benefit and includes many factors
      beyond water purification. Think about the direct cost
      of replacing the specific purification service.'
     
     [If D selected]:
     'Carbon storage is another valuable ecosystem service,
      but it's separate from water purification. We're
      asking specifically about valuing the filtration
      service wetlands provide.'"
```

**Feedback Quality Criteria:**
- Explains why answer correct/incorrect
- Addresses misconceptions
- References concepts
- Instructional, not judgmental
- Appropriate length

**Teacher Review:**
- Feedback pedagogically sound?
- Addresses actual reasoning?
- Helpful for learning?
- Appropriate tone?

### Step 5: Metadata Completion

**AI Completes Technical Metadata:**
```yaml
question_id: Q-Bio-Eco-023
learning_objective: LO-Eco-Services-03
bloom_level: Apply
difficulty: Medium
points: 2

## DIALOGUE EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Format Selection Dialogue

```
AI: "Question 8 on 'stages of mitosis'
     
     Current content: Students should identify correct
     sequence of prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase
     
     Format options:
     A) Multiple Choice - select correct sequence
     B) Matching - match stages to descriptions
     C) Short Answer - list stages in order with brief
        description of each
     
     Recommendation: Matching
     Reason: Tests both sequence AND understanding of
             each stage's characteristics"

Teacher: "No, Multiple Choice. They need to demonstrate
         sequence mastery specifically. We'll have other
         questions on stage characteristics."

AI: "Understood. Creating multiple choice with:
     - Correct sequence as option A
     - Common errors as distractors (swapped stages)
     - Clear formatting for readability"
```

### Example 2: Distractor Quality Dialogue

```
AI: "Question 15: 'What is the primary function of
     mitochondria?'
     
     Options created:
     A) Energy production through cellular respiration ✓
     B) Protein synthesis
     C) Lipid synthesis
     D) DNA replication"

Teacher: "B, C, and D are too obviously wrong. Biology
         students know mitochondria aren't primarily for
         those functions. Need more subtle distractors."

AI: "Revised distractors:
     A) Energy production through cellular respiration ✓
     B) ATP storage and distribution
        [correct organelle, wrong emphasis]
     C) Glucose breakdown to pyruvate
        [correct process, wrong organelle - that's cytoplasm]
     D) Oxidative metabolism and calcium regulation
        [partly correct but incomplete, overemphasizes
         secondary function]
     
     These require actual understanding to eliminate"

Teacher: "Much better. These are plausible."
```

### Example 3: Feedback Quality Dialogue

```
AI: "Feedback for Question 12 (cell membrane transport):
     
     [If correct]:
     'Correct.'
     
     [If incorrect]:
     'Incorrect. Review membrane transport mechanisms.'"

Teacher: "Too brief. Students need to understand WHY
         their answer was right or wrong, not just know
         the outcome."

AI: "Revised feedback:
     
     [If Correct - Active transport selected]:
     'Correct! Active transport uses cellular energy (ATP)
      to move substances against their concentration
      gradient. The sodium-potassium pump is a key example,
      maintaining critical ion gradients for nerve function.'
     
     [If Incorrect - Passive diffusion selected]:
     'Passive diffusion doesn't require energy and only
      moves substances DOWN their concentration gradient.
      This question asks about moving substances AGAINST
      the gradient, which requires active transport and
      ATP energy. Consider what makes a process 'active.''
     
     [If Incorrect - Osmosis selected]:
     'Osmosis is a type of passive transport specific to
      water movement. While important, it can't move
      substances against concentration gradients. Look
      for the process that requires cellular energy input.'"

Teacher: "Perfect. Now students learn from the feedback."
```
