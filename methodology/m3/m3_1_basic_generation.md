# BUILDING BLOCK 4b: STAGE 4A - BASIC GENERATION

**Component:** Building Block 4b  
**Framework:** Modular Question Generation System  
**Stage:** Stage 4A - Basic Generation  
**Classification:** 🔶 TEACHER-LED CREATIVE DIALOGUE  
**Duration:** ~2-3 hours  
**Primary Input:** Assessment blueprint from BB2, content analysis from BB1  
**Primary Output:** Generated question content (pre-distribution validation)

---

## PURPOSE

Stage 4A focuses exclusively on **content creation**. This stage is about generating rich, pedagogically sound question content without worrying about distribution, formatting, or technical details.

### Stage Focus

**What Stage 4A IS:**
- Creative content generation
- Exploring pedagogical possibilities
- Building question substance
- Teacher-directed ideation

**What Stage 4A IS NOT:**
- Distribution checking (that's Stage 4B)
- Technical formatting (that's Stage 4C)
- Final quality assurance (that's BB5)

---

## DIALOGUE CHARACTER: EXPLORATIVE AND CREATIVE

### Dialogue Purpose

Stage 4A dialogue is **explorative** - it helps teachers articulate their pedagogical vision and develop it into concrete question content.

**Dialogue Goals:**
- Understand teacher's pedagogical intentions
- Propose content that matches vision
- Generate variations and alternatives
- Refine content through iteration

### Roles in Stage 4A

**Teacher's Role:**
- Directs content focus
- Shares pedagogical vision
- Provides examples and context
- Evaluates proposals
- Guides refinement

**AI's Role:**
- Proposes initial content
- Generates variations
- Implements teacher guidance
- Documents decisions
- Maintains pedagogical alignment

---

## STAGE 4A PROCESS

### Step 1: Initial Content Direction

**Teacher Provides:**
- Which learning objectives to address
- Content priorities and emphasis
- Preferred contexts or scenarios
- Difficulty expectations
- Any specific pedagogical approaches

**Example Initiation:**
```
Teacher: "We need questions on ecosystem services for 
         master's students in environmental engineering."
```

### Step 2: AI Proposes Content Approach

**AI Clarifies:**
- Content focus options
- Potential approaches
- Context possibilities
- Example scenarios

**Example AI Response:**
```
AI: "I can focus on:
     1. Theoretical concepts (definitions, classifications)
     2. Practical applications (real-world scenarios)
     3. Valuation methods (economic assessment)
     What's your priority?"
```

### Step 3: Teacher Directs and Refines

**Teacher Specifies:**
- Priority focus areas
- Context preferences
- Example requirements
- Depth and detail level

**Example Teacher Direction:**
```
Teacher: "Mainly 2 and 3, students know the theory. 
         Use Swedish case studies, particularly 
         Gothenburg and the West Coast."
```

### Step 4: AI Generates Initial Content

**AI Creates:**
- Question stems
- Scenarios and contexts
- Problem situations
- Assessment prompts

**Aligned With:**
- Teacher's specified focus
- Learning objective requirements
- Difficulty level guidance
- Context preferences

### Step 5: Iterative Refinement

**Refinement Cycle:**
```
AI generates → Teacher evaluates → Teacher guides adjustments →
AI refines → Teacher approves → Move to next question
```

**Example Refinement:**
```
Teacher: "Good, but also include urban examples,
         not just marine ecosystems."

AI: "Adjusting the ecosystem balance to include:
     - Urban stormwater management
     - City park cooling effects
     - Urban pollination services
     Along with existing marine examples"

Teacher: "Perfect, proceed with that mix"
```

## DIALOGUE EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Science Content Generation

```
Teacher: "I need questions on cell division for Year 1 
         biology students."

AI: "Should we focus on:
     A) Mitosis mechanics and stages
     B) Cell cycle regulation
     C) Meiosis and genetic variation
     D) Clinical applications (cancer, reproduction)"

Teacher: "Primarily A and D. They need to understand 
         the process AND why it matters medically."

AI: "Generating questions that:
     - Test understanding of mitosis stages
     - Apply knowledge to medical scenarios
     - Use examples like cancer screening and fertility
     Should I include comparison with meiosis?"

Teacher: "Yes, but only to highlight mitosis differences,
         not assess meiosis in depth."

AI: "Creating content with focused mitosis assessment 
     and strategic meiosis comparisons..."
```

### Example 2: Humanities Content Generation

```
Teacher: "Questions on Swedish welfare state development 
         for political science undergraduates."

AI: "Time period focus?
     1. Historical origins (1930s-1950s)
     2. Golden age (1960s-1970s)
     3. Crisis and reforms (1990s-2000s)
     4. Contemporary challenges"

Teacher: "Focus on 2 and 3. Compare golden age 
         characteristics with 1990s crisis responses."

AI: "Should questions emphasize:
     - Policy specifics
     - Political actors and decisions
     - Economic factors
     - International comparisons?"

Teacher: "Mix of policy and political actors. Use actual 
         reform examples - pension reform, labor market."

AI: "Generating scenarios with specific reform examples 
     and political decision-making contexts..."
```

### Example 3: Technical Content Generation

```
Teacher: "Need questions on SQL queries for database 
         course, intermediate level."

AI: "Query complexity level?
     A) Single table SELECT with WHERE
     B) JOIN operations (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
     C) Subqueries and nested SELECT
     D) Aggregate functions and GROUP BY"

Teacher: "B and D primarily. Students struggle with 
         JOIN logic and aggregation together."

AI: "Should scenarios use:
     - Academic database (students, courses)?
     - Business database (customers, orders)?
     - Other domain?"

Teacher: "Business database. More realistic for their 
         future work. Include inventory and sales."

AI: "Creating SQL scenarios with business contexts:
     - Customer order analysis
     - Inventory management queries
     - Sales performance aggregation
     All requiring JOIN + aggregate combinations"
```

## COMMON PITFALLS AND SOLUTIONS

### Pitfall 1: Mixing Stage Concerns

**Problem:** Teacher or AI starts worrying about distribution while generating content

**Solution:**
- Remind: "We'll analyze distribution in Stage 4B"
- Focus: "Let's get the content right first"
- Separate: Each stage has its purpose

### Pitfall 2: Premature Perfection

**Problem:** Spending too much time perfecting individual questions

**Solution:**
- Stage 4A is about content substance
- Technical polish happens in Stage 4C
- Quality assurance happens in BB5
- Generate first, refine strategically later

### Pitfall 3: Insufficient Teacher Direction

**Problem:** AI generates without clear teacher guidance

**Solution:**
- AI must ask clarifying questions
- Teacher provides specific direction
- Examples help guide generation
- Dialogue ensures alignment

### Pitfall 4: Quantity Over Quality

**Problem:** Rushing through to generate many questions quickly

**Solution:**
- Stage 4A values pedagogical quality
- Each question should match teacher's vision
- Better to generate fewer high-quality questions
- Quantity balancing happens in Stage 4B

## STAGE 4A COMPLETION CHECKPOINT

✅ **This stage is now complete.**

**REQUIRED VERIFICATION:**
- [ ] All prioritized learning objectives have content generated
- [ ] Content matches teacher's pedagogical vision
- [ ] Scenarios and contexts appropriate for students
- [ ] Disciplinary accuracy confirmed
- [ ] Teacher approves all generated content
- [ ] Pedagogical decisions documented

**REQUIRED ACTIONS:**
1. Review all generated content
2. Confirm content quality and appropriateness
3. Verify alignment with learning objectives
4. Document any remaining concerns for Stage 4B
5. WAIT for explicit instruction to proceed to Stage 4B

**Teacher must explicitly say:** "Proceed to Stage 4B" or "Start distribution review"

**DO NOT proceed automatically to Stage 4B.**
