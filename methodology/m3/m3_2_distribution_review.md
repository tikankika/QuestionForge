---

## PURPOSE

Stage 4B focuses exclusively on **systematic analysis** of the complete question set. This stage validates coverage, checks distributions, and ensures the question set works as a coherent assessment instrument.

### Stage Focus

**What Stage 4B IS:**
- Coverage validation
- Distribution analysis
- Strategic decision-making
- Balancing and adjustment

**What Stage 4B IS NOT:**
- Content creation (that was Stage 4A)
- Technical formatting (that's Stage 4C)
- Individual question polishing (that's Stage 4C)

---

## DIALOGUE CHARACTER: ANALYTICAL AND DECISION-DRIVEN

Stage 4B dialogue is **analytical** - it presents objective data and supports teacher's strategic decisions about the question set as a whole.

**Dialogue Goals:**
- Present coverage and distribution analysis
- Identify gaps or imbalances
- Propose adjustment strategies
- Implement teacher's decisions

### Roles in Stage 4B

**Teacher's Role:**
- Reviews analysis data
- Makes strategic decisions
- Determines priorities
- Approves adjustments
- Decides when to proceed

**AI's Role:**
- Analyzes question set systematically
- Presents clear data visualizations
- Identifies issues objectively
- Proposes adjustment options
- Implements approved changes

---

## STAGE 4B PROCESS

### Step 1: Systematic Analysis

**AI Analyzes Complete Question Set:**

**Coverage Analysis:**
- Which learning objectives are covered
- How many questions per objective
- Coverage of Tier 1/2/3 objectives
- Identification of gaps

**Distribution Analysis:**
- Bloom's taxonomy levels
- Question type distribution
- Difficulty distribution
- Point value allocation

**Balance Analysis:**
- Proportional representation
- Alignment with blueprint targets
- Variance from specifications

### Step 2: Present Analysis to Teacher

**AI Presentation Format:**
```
Analysis of [N] generated questions:

COVERAGE:
- Learning Objective LO-01: 4 questions ✅
- Learning Objective LO-02: 3 questions ✅
- Learning Objective LO-03: 1 question ⚠️ (minimum 2)
- Learning Objective LO-04: 0 questions ❌ (gap)

BLOOM'S DISTRIBUTION:
- Remember: 12% (target 15%) ✅ within tolerance
- Understand: 28% (target 25%) ✅ within tolerance
- Apply: 32% (target 35%) ⚠️ slightly low
- Analyze: 20% (target 20%) ✅ match
- Evaluate: 8% (target 5%) ⚠️ slightly high

DIFFICULTY DISTRIBUTION:
- Easy: 35% (target 30%) ✅ within tolerance
- Medium: 48% (target 50%) ✅ within tolerance
- Hard: 17% (target 20%) ⚠️ slightly low

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add 1-2 questions for LO-03
2. Generate questions for LO-04
3. Consider adding 2-3 Apply-level questions
4. Optional: Add 1 Hard question
```

### Step 3: Teacher Evaluates and Decides

**Teacher Considers:**
- Are gaps acceptable or must they be filled?
- Which imbalances matter most?
- What's the priority order for adjustments?
- When is distribution "good enough"?

**Teacher Decisions:**
- Accept current distribution
- Request specific additions
- Request removals or replacements
- Prioritize certain adjustments over others

### Step 4: AI Proposes Adjustment Strategy

**AI Suggests:**
- Which questions to add (specific focus)
- Which questions could be removed
- Which questions could be modified
- Implementation approach

**Example AI Proposal:**
```
To address identified gaps:

1. Add 2 questions for LO-03 (minimum coverage):
   - Focus: [specific content area]
   - Level: Apply (to help distribution)
   - Difficulty: 1 Medium, 1 Hard (to help distribution)

2. Add 3-4 questions for LO-04:
   - Mixed cognitive levels
   - Balanced difficulty
   - Complete coverage

3. Optional: Remove 2 lowest-priority Remember questions
   - Creates space for Apply questions
   - Improves cognitive balance

Estimated time: 30-45 minutes for additions
```

### Step 5: Implement Approved Adjustments

**AI Implements:**
- Generate specified additional questions
- Remove approved questions
- Modify existing questions if approved
- Maintain content quality from Stage 4A

**Teacher Reviews:**
- New questions meet standards
- Adjustments address issues
- Overall set now balanced

### Step 6: Re-Analyze and Validate

**AI Re-Analyzes:**
- Updated coverage
- New distributions
- Remaining variances
- Achievement of targets

**Teacher Decides:**
- Accept current state (proceed to Stage 4C)
- Further refinement needed (iterate)
- Major revision required (return to Stage 4A)

## DIALOGUE EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Coverage Gap Dialogue

```
AI: "Analysis of 45 generated questions:
     - Learning Objective LO-Bio-Cell-03 has only 1 question
     - Minimum requirement is 2 questions
     - This objective is Tier 1 (essential)
     
     Recommend: Add 1-2 questions for this objective"

Teacher: "What specific content is LO-03?"

AI: "LO-03: 'Explain the role of cell membrane in 
     substance transport and cell communication'
     
     Current question covers passive transport.
     Gap: Active transport and cell signaling"

Teacher: "Add 2 questions: one on active transport 
         (sodium-potassium pump), one on receptor-
         mediated signaling."

AI: "Generating:
     - Active transport question (Apply level)
     - Cell signaling question (Analyze level)
     Both Medium difficulty to maintain balance"
```

### Example 2: Distribution Imbalance Dialogue

```
AI: "Bloom's distribution analysis:
     - Apply: 28% (target 35%, variance -7%)
     - Evaluate: 12% (target 5%, variance +7%)
     
     We have too many Evaluate and too few Apply questions"

Teacher: "Which Evaluate questions are lowest priority?"

AI: "Questions 34 and 41 are Evaluate but assess 
     Tier 3 (nice-to-have) objectives. They could 
     be replaced with Apply questions on Tier 1 objectives"

Teacher: "Replace them. What Apply content do we need?"

AI: "Tier 1 objectives LO-02 and LO-05 only have 
     Remember/Understand questions. Adding Apply 
     questions there would strengthen coverage AND 
     improve distribution"

Teacher: "Perfect. Replace Q34 and Q41 with Apply 
         questions for LO-02 and LO-05"

AI: "Implementing replacement strategy..."
```

### Example 3: Strategic Priority Dialogue

```
AI: "Multiple variances detected:
     1. LO-08 has 0 questions (Tier 2 objective)
     2. Bloom's Apply is -5% from target
     3. Hard difficulty is -3% from target
     
     All adjustments possible, but require different effort"

Teacher: "What's the impact of each?"

AI: "Analysis:
     1. LO-08 gap: Moderate impact, Tier 2 objective
        Effort: ~20 minutes (2-3 questions)
     
     2. Apply variance: Low impact (within tolerance)
        Effort: ~15 minutes (1-2 questions)
     
     3. Hard variance: Low impact (within tolerance)
        Effort: ~20 minutes (1-2 questions)"

Teacher: "Address #1 only. The others are acceptable 
         variances for formative assessment"

AI: "Understood. Generating 2 questions for LO-08, 
     leaving other distributions as-is"
```

## COMMON PITFALLS AND SOLUTIONS

### Pitfall 1: Pursuing Perfection

**Problem:** Trying to achieve exact distribution targets

**Solution:**
- ±5% variance often acceptable
- Formative assessments more forgiving
- Time investment vs. benefit
- Teacher decides "good enough"

### Pitfall 2: Ignoring Critical Gaps

**Problem:** Accepting gaps in essential (Tier 1) objectives

**Solution:**
- Tier 1 objectives require coverage
- Minimum 2 questions per essential objective
- Some gaps matter more than others
- Strategic prioritization needed

### Pitfall 3: Analysis Paralysis

**Problem:** Spending too long analyzing without deciding

**Solution:**
- Analysis should be quick (~10-15 minutes)
- Decisions more important than perfect analysis
- Act on clear priorities first
- Accept imperfection strategically

### Pitfall 4: Independent AI Decisions

**Problem:** AI making adjustment decisions without teacher approval

**Solution:**
- AI presents options, teacher decides
- No additions/removals without approval
- Teacher sets priorities explicitly
- Dialogue ensures alignment
