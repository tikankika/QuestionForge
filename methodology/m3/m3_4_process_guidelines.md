## THE ITERATIVE DIALOGIC PROCESS

### Iteration Patterns with Teacher Control

#### Pattern 1: Refinement Through Dialogue
```
AI proposes content/format/analysis
    ↓
Teacher provides guidance and direction
    ↓
AI adjusts based on teacher feedback
    ↓
Teacher approves or requests further revision
    ↓
[Iterate until teacher satisfied]
```

**Application:**
- Stage 4A: Content refinement
- Stage 4B: Adjustment strategies
- Stage 4C: Format and quality improvements

**Example:**
```
AI: "Generated question on ecosystem services..."
Teacher: "Good start, but use Swedish examples"
AI: "Revised with Gothenburg watershed example"
Teacher: "Perfect, approved"
```

---

#### Pattern 2: Problem-Solving Together
```
AI identifies issue or gap
    ↓
Teacher determines approach to address
    ↓
AI implements teacher's solution
    ↓
Teacher validates implementation
    ↓
[Iterate if needed]
```

**Application:**
- Stage 4B: Coverage gaps
- Stage 4B: Distribution imbalances
- Stage 4C: Quality issues

**Example:**
```
AI: "LO-03 has only 1 question (minimum 2)"
Teacher: "Add one more at Apply level, medium difficulty"
AI: "Generated additional question meeting specifications"
Teacher: "Approved, gap addressed"
```

---

#### Pattern 3: Quality Enhancement
```
Teacher gives specific feedback on quality
    ↓
AI revises to address feedback
    ↓
Teacher evaluates revised version
    ↓
[Iterate until quality standards met]
```

**Application:**
- Stage 4A: Content quality
- Stage 4C: Distractor improvement
- Stage 4C: Feedback enhancement

**Example:**
```
Teacher: "These distractors too obviously wrong"
AI: "Revised with more subtle, misconception-based options"
Teacher: "Much better, these are plausible"
```

## AI'S PROHIBITED ACTIONS

### What AI Must NEVER Do

1. **Make Pedagogical Decisions Independently**
   - ❌ Decide what content to assess
   - ❌ Determine pedagogical approaches
   - ❌ Override teacher's content priorities
   - ❌ Make difficulty decisions without input

2. **Change Teacher's Priorities**
   - ❌ Deprioritize teacher-specified content
   - ❌ Emphasize different learning objectives
   - ❌ Adjust coverage without approval
   - ❌ Modify strategic decisions

3. **Proceed Without Approval**
   - ❌ Move to next stage automatically
   - ❌ Generate beyond requested amount
   - ❌ Implement changes without confirmation
   - ❌ Finalize without teacher review

4. **Compromise Quality for Efficiency**
   - ❌ Accept weak distractors to save time
   - ❌ Skip feedback development
   - ❌ Rush through quality checks
   - ❌ Reduce standards for completion

5. **Override Teacher Judgment**
   - ❌ Argue against teacher decisions
   - ❌ Implement alternative to approved approach
   - ❌ Modify teacher-approved content
   - ❌ Change quality standards

6. **Implement Without Direction**
   - ❌ Generate questions without specifications
   - ❌ Make format choices without consultation
   - ❌ Develop feedback without guidance
   - ❌ Proceed on assumptions

Random generation
Mixed concerns
Extensive rework needed
Variable quality
Frustration
    ↓
7-8 hours of work, uncertain results
```

**Three-Stage Model:**
```
Structured dialogue with teacher leading
    ↓
Clear expectations (Stage 4A)
Focused content creation
Validated coverage (Stage 4B)
Strategic adjustments
Professional formatting (Stage 4C)
Quality assurance
    ↓
5 hours of work, consistent quality
```

### Key Differences

| Aspect | Traditional | Three-Stage Model |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| **Teacher Role** | Reactive correction | Proactive direction |
| **AI Role** | Autonomous (unclear) | Supportive (clear) |
| **Process** | Chaotic mixing | Structured sequence |
| **Focus** | Everything at once | One thing at a time |
| **Quality** | Variable, luck-based | Consistent, systematic |
| **Time** | 7-8 hours | 5 hours |
| **Result** | Uncertain quality | Predictable quality |
| **Satisfaction** | Frustration common | Control and confidence |
