## STAGE 3: EXAMPLE CATALOG

**Duration:** 20-30 minutes  
**Nature:** Systematic inquiry about effective examples  
**Purpose:** Document instructional examples that worked well

---

### FOR CLAUDE: Example Documentation Strategy

#### Context

Stage 3 builds on Stage 0's initial example identification. During material analysis, Claude noted examples, demonstrations, and activities used in instruction. Stage 3 systematically expands this preliminary list through dialogue.

At this point:
- Stage 0 provided initial example catalog (preliminary, incomplete)
- Stage 2 discussed which examples worked best for emphasis topics
- Stage 3 comprehensively documents ALL effective examples

This stage focuses on cataloging examples that can become question scenarios in BB4.

---

#### Opening Context

```
You used various examples, demonstrations, and activities to teach these concepts. 
I want to catalog the most effective ones—those that helped students understand, 
that you'd use again, that illustrated concepts clearly. These examples will 
inform question scenarios later.

Let's go through your Tier 1 topics and identify the best examples for each...
```

#### Topic Progression Strategy

Work through content systematically:

1. **Start with Stage 0's example list** as reference (don't start from scratch)
2. **Work through Tier 1 topics** in order (chronological from Stage 0)
3. **For each topic, ask all 5 inquiry areas** (Primary, Demonstrations, Real-world, Visual, Case studies)
4. **After Tier 1 complete**, briefly catalog Tier 2 examples if significant
5. **Skip Tier 3/4 examples** (background only, not for assessment)

Refer to Stage 0's preliminary list to prompt teacher memory, then expand with dialogue.

---

#### Systematic Inquiry

For each major concept (especially Tier 1), ask:

**1. Primary Illustration:**
"What example best illustrated [Concept A]?"

*Follow-ups:*
- "Where did this appear?" (lecture, slide, handout)
- "How did you use it?" (demonstration, comparison, calculation)
- "Why did this example work well?"

**2. Demonstrations & Activities:**
"Did students do any hands-on work with [Concept B]?"

*Follow-ups:*
- "What was the activity?"
- "What did it help them understand?"
- "How did they respond?"

**3. Real-World Applications:**
"What real-world connection did you make for [Concept C]?"

*Follow-ups:*
- "Why that application?"
- "Did it resonate with students?"
- "Would you use it again?"

**4. Visual Aids:**
"Were there any diagrams, graphs, or images that were particularly effective?"

*Follow-ups:*
- "What did it show?"
- "What made it helpful?"
- "Did students reference it later?"

**5. Case Studies or Scenarios:**
"Did you use any extended examples or case studies?"

*Follow-ups:*
- "What was the case?"
- "What did it illustrate?"
- "How complex was it?"

#### Example Selection Criteria

**Quality over Quantity:**
- Focus on examples that were EFFECTIVE (students understood)
- Include examples you'd DEFINITELY use again
- Prioritize examples with MEMORABLE student response

**Quantity Guidelines:**
- Tier 1 topics: 2-4 examples each (depending on topic complexity)
- Tier 2 topics: 1-2 examples each
- Total target: 15-25 examples across all topics (not exhaustive)

Don't catalog every example mentioned in materials—focus on the best ones.

---

#### Catalog Organization

Group examples by concept/topic, not chronologically:

```markdown
## INSTRUCTIONAL EXAMPLE CATALOG

### [Tier 1 Topic A]

**Example 1: [Name/Description]**
- Source: [Lecture 2, Slide 15 / Handout p. 3]
- Illustrates: [Specific concept or principle]
- Why effective: [Teacher's explanation]
- Type: [Demonstration / Comparison / Application / Visual]
- Student response: [How students engaged]

**Example 2: [Name/Description]**
- [Similar structure]

### [Tier 1 Topic B]

**Example 3: [Name/Description]**
- [Structure]

[Continue for all major topics]
```

#### Probing Strategies

**When teacher describes example:**
→ "What did that help students understand specifically?"
→ "Would you use that example again? Why/why not?"

**When teacher mentions multiple examples:**
→ "Which one worked best?"
→ "Why was that one more effective than others?"

**When example seems complex:**
→ "How much detail did you go into?"
→ "Could students follow it, or was it overwhelming?"

**When teacher can't recall specifics:**
→ "That's OK. Do you remember the general type of example?"
→ "Even rough descriptions are helpful."

#### Documentation Focus

Capture:
- [ ] Example name/description
- [ ] Location in materials (for reference)
- [ ] What concept it illustrates
- [ ] Why teacher found it effective
- [ ] Type of example (demonstration, case, visual, etc.)
- [ ] Student response (if memorable)

**Where to Document:**
Create Example Catalog document (part of BB1 output package). This catalog will be referenced in Stage 5 learning objectives and used in BB4 question scenario development.

### FOR TEACHERS: How to Catalog Examples

**What We're Doing:**
Documenting the examples, demonstrations, and activities you used to teach concepts—especially those that worked well.

**Why This Matters:**
These examples may become scenarios in assessment questions. Knowing which examples students understand helps create better questions.

**Most Helpful:**

✅ **Concrete descriptions:**
"The EV vs. ICE lifecycle comparison from Transport & Environment—I showed the bar chart comparing emissions by stage."

✅ **Effectiveness notes:**
"That example really clicked because students could see the battery impact visually."

✅ **Usage context:**
"I used it in Lecture 2 to introduce lifecycle thinking, then referred back to it in Lectures 3 and 5."

✅ **Student response:**
"Students still referenced that example weeks later when discussing electricity mix."

**Note:** This example is from an environmental science course. Your examples will reflect your subject area (e.g., cell diagrams in biology, proofs in mathematics, primary sources in history, etc.).

**Less Helpful:**

❌ **"I used many examples"** (which ones specifically?)
❌ **Listing without context** (what did each illustrate?)
❌ **Vague descriptions** ("some charts")

**Don't Worry About:**
- Perfect recall (rough descriptions work)
- Having an example for everything (focus on what worked)
- Explaining pedagogical theory (just describe what you did)

**Format to Expect:**

Claude will go topic-by-topic asking:
- "What example illustrated X?"
- "Did you do any activities for Y?"
- "What real-world application for Z?"

Just describe what you remember using.

### Validation Checkpoint Format

```
Example Catalog (Stage 3)

Here are the key instructional examples documented:

[TIER 1 TOPIC A]: [N] examples cataloged
- Example 1: [Brief description]
- Example 2: [Brief description]

[TIER 1 TOPIC B]: [N] examples cataloged
- Example 3: [Brief description]

[TIER 2 TOPICS]: [N] examples cataloged

Total: [N] examples documented across all topics

These examples will inform question scenario development in BB4.

Any major examples I missed? Ready for Stage 4 (Misconceptions)?
```

## STAGE 3 COMPLETION CHECKPOINT

**When Stage 3 example cataloging is complete:**

### CRITICAL: STOP HERE

**DO NOT PROCEED AUTOMATICALLY TO STAGE 4**

### Required Actions:
1. **PRESENT** the example catalog to the teacher
2. **CONFIRM** no major examples were missed
3. **STOP and WAIT** for teacher approval to proceed

### Stage 4 Requirements:
Before proceeding to Stage 4, you MUST have:
- ✅ bb1f (Stage4_Misconception_Analysis.md) instructions loaded
- ✅ Teacher has reviewed example catalog
- ✅ Teacher explicitly says: "Start Stage 4" or "Proceed to misconception analysis"
- ✅ Example catalog documented and saved

### DO NOT:
- ❌ Start Stage 4 dialogue without teacher approval
- ❌ Proceed without bb1f instructions loaded
- ❌ Improvise misconception analysis questions
- ❌ Assume catalog is complete without confirmation
- ❌ Skip the explicit approval step

### Transition Statement:
"Stage 3 example cataloging is now complete. I have documented the key instructional examples above, organized by topic:
- [N] examples for Tier 1 topics
- [N] examples for Tier 2 topics
- Total: [N] examples across all major concepts

To proceed to Stage 4 (Misconception Analysis), I need:
1. Your confirmation that no major examples were missed
2. Explicit instruction to proceed
3. bb1f file loaded (Stage 4 instructions)

Please review the example catalog and let me know when you're ready to start Stage 4."
