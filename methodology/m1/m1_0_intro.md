**Process Nature:** Structured dialogue with adaptive inquiry  
**Primary Purpose:** Transform conducted instruction into validated learning objectives  
**Primary Output:** Learning objectives with evidence + supporting documentation

---

## FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES

### What BB1 Does
**Building Block 1 DESCRIBES what was taught.**  
**Building Block 2 DESIGNS how to assess it.**

This building block focuses exclusively on understanding conducted instruction through systematic analysis and dynamic dialogue. All assessment design decisions (Bloom's distributions, question counts, difficulty calibration) belong in BB2.

### Dialogue, Not Interrogation
BB1 is a **conversation** between Claude and teacher, not a rigid checklist. Claude adapts questions based on responses, probes interesting details, and follows the natural flow of dialogue while maintaining systematic coverage.

### Role Separation
This document contains instructions for **both Claude and teachers**, clearly marked:
- **FOR CLAUDE:** How to facilitate the dialogue
- **FOR TEACHERS:** What to expect and how to participate

---

## USING THIS DOCUMENTATION

### Modular Structure
BB1 documentation is organized into modular files for easier navigation and updates:

- **bb1a (this file):** Framework overview, principles, and process introduction
- **bb1b-bb1g:** Detailed facilitation strategies for each of the 5 stages
- **bb1h:** Cross-cutting facilitation principles and best practices

### How to Navigate
- **First-time users:** Read bb1a completely to understand the overall framework
- **During facilitation:** Reference specific stage files (bb1b-bb1g) as needed
- **Troubleshooting dialogue:** Consult bb1h for facilitation principles and common pitfalls
- **Quick reference:** Each stage file is self-contained with both Claude and teacher guidance

## CONCEPTUAL FOUNDATION

### The Challenge
Teachers possess deep implicit knowledge about their instruction—what they emphasized, why certain examples worked, where students struggled. But this knowledge is often tacit, not explicitly documented. BB1 externalizes this knowledge through structured dialogue.

### The Process
Through 5 stages, Claude and teacher collaborate to create:
1. **Content architecture** - What topics, in what priority order
2. **Example catalog** - Which illustrations worked best
3. **Misconception registry** - Common student errors
4. **Scope boundaries** - What's in vs. out for assessment
5. **Learning objectives** - Specific, measurable, evidence-based

### Process Flow
The stages are designed to build systematically: Stage 0 provides initial analysis for Stage 1 validation, which establishes the foundation for Stage 2's deeper inquiry. Stages 3 and 4 run in parallel, documenting examples and misconceptions that inform Stage 5's synthesis of learning objectives. Each stage includes validation checkpoints to ensure accuracy before advancing.

### The Output
Validated learning objectives that reflect **actual teaching** (not just planned curriculum), providing the foundation for systematic assessment design in BB2.

## CRITICAL: REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION

### All BB1 Files Must Be Available Before Starting

**DO NOT BEGIN** any stage without having ALL corresponding instruction files loaded:

**Required Files Checklist:**
- [ ] bb1a: Introduction & Framework (this file)
- [ ] bb1b: Stage 0 - Material Analysis
- [ ] bb1c: Stage 1 - Initial Validation
- [ ] bb1d: Stage 2 - Emphasis Refinement
- [ ] bb1e: Stage 3 - Example Catalog
- [ ] bb1f: Stage 4 - Misconception Analysis
- [ ] bb1g: Stage 5 - Scope Boundaries & Learning Objectives
- [ ] bb1h: Facilitation Best Practices

### WARNING: Do Not Improvise

**NEVER proceed with any stage without the corresponding instruction file.**

**If you only have bb1a and bb1b:**
- ✅ You can START Stage 0 (Material Analysis)
- ❌ You CANNOT proceed to Stage 1 without bb1c
- ❌ You CANNOT improvise validation questions
- ❌ You CANNOT guess what comes next

**Each stage file contains:**
- Specific dialogue strategies
- Required question frameworks
- Output formats
- Validation checkpoints
- Stage completion criteria

**Without these instructions, the methodology breaks down.**

### Stage Gate Requirements

**Before starting each stage, verify:**
1. The stage instruction file (bb1b-bb1g) is loaded
2. Previous stage is complete (if applicable)
3. Teacher has explicitly approved proceeding
4. You understand the stage-specific requirements

**If any requirement is missing: STOP and request the needed file or approval.**

## PREREQUISITES

Before beginning BB1, teachers should prepare:

**Required Materials:**
- Instructional materials: lectures, slides, readings, handouts
- See bb1b (Stage 0: Material Analysis) for complete material specifications

**Time Commitment:**
- Stage 0 (Claude's independent work): 60-90 minutes
- Stages 1-5 (collaborative dialogue): 90-120 minutes
- Total process: 2.5-3.5 hours

**Technical Requirements:**
- None for teachers (conversation-based)
- Claude requires access to all instructional materials

---

## THE FIVE-STAGE PROCESS

BB1 consists of five sequential stages, each documented in detail in separate files:

### Stage 0: Material Analysis (bb1b)
**Duration:** 60-90 minutes  
**Nature:** Claude's independent analysis before dialogue  
**Purpose:** Understand instructional content to prepare for dialogue  
**Output:** Initial content architecture with priority tiers, example catalog, misconception notes  
**Required File:** bb1b

### Stage 1: Initial Validation (bb1c)
**Duration:** 20-30 minutes  
**Nature:** Validation dialogue  
**Purpose:** Confirm Stage 0 analysis accuracy before detailed dialogue  
**Output:** Validated priority structure with teacher corrections  
**Required File:** bb1c

### Stage 2: Emphasis Refinement (bb1d)
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes  
**Nature:** Dynamic dialogue with adaptive inquiry  
**Purpose:** Refine understanding of content priorities and pedagogical rationale  
**Output:** Refined understanding of emphasis patterns, teaching approaches, assessment priorities  
**Required File:** bb1d

### Stage 3: Example Catalog (bb1e)
**Duration:** 20-30 minutes  
**Nature:** Systematic inquiry about effective examples  
**Purpose:** Document instructional examples that worked well  
**Output:** Organized catalog of examples by topic with effectiveness notes  
**Required File:** bb1e

### Stage 4: Misconception Registry (bb1f)
**Duration:** 20-30 minutes  
**Nature:** Systematic inquiry about student errors  
**Purpose:** Document common misconceptions for distractor development  
**Output:** Registry of misconceptions with severity ratings and correction strategies  
**Required File:** bb1f

### Stage 5: Scope Boundaries & Learning Objectives (bb1g)
**Duration:** 45-60 minutes  
**Nature:** Clarification dialogue + synthesis  
**Purpose:** Finalize scope and synthesize validated learning objectives  
**Output:** Complete learning objectives with evidence, scope boundaries, transition notes for BB2  
**Required File:** bb1g

**See individual stage documents (bb1b-bb1g) for detailed facilitation strategies and guidance.**

**For dialogue facilitation principles and common pitfalls, see bb1h (Facilitation Best Practices).**
