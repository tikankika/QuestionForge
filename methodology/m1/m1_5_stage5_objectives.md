## STAGE 5: SCOPE BOUNDARIES & LEARNING OBJECTIVES

**Duration:** 45-60 minutes  
**Nature:** Clarification dialogue + synthesis  
**Purpose:** Finalize scope and synthesize learning objectives

---

### Context

Stage 5 is the synthesis stage that integrates ALL previous work into validated learning objectives. This stage has two parts:

**PART A: Scope Boundaries** - Clarifies what's IN/OUT of assessment scope based on Stages 0-2 content architecture and emphasis patterns.

**PART B: Learning Objectives Synthesis** - Creates learning objectives by integrating:
- Stage 0: Content architecture (Tiers 1-4)
- Stage 1: Validated priority structure
- Stage 2: Emphasis rationale and assessment focus
- Stage 3: Instructional examples
- Stage 4: Common misconceptions

This is the final BB1 stage - outputs become the foundation for BB2 (Assessment Design).

### PART A: SCOPE BOUNDARIES (15-20 minutes)

#### FOR CLAUDE: Boundary Clarification Strategy

**Opening:**
```
Before synthesizing learning objectives, I want to establish clear boundaries—
what content is IN scope for assessment, what's borderline, and what's 
explicitly OUT. This prevents scope creep during question generation.
```

**Systematic Inquiry:**

**1. Definite IN:**
"Let's confirm: Tier 1 content is definitely in scope for assessment?"
→ List all Tier 1 topics for confirmation

**2. Borderline (Tier 2/3):**
"For Tier 2 content, should we assess it at basic level, exclude it, or make it conditional?"

*Ask for each Tier 2 item:*
- "Include [Topic X] in assessment?" 
- If yes: "Basic recognition or deeper understanding?"
- If no: "Why exclude?"

**3. Definite OUT:**
"Let's confirm what's explicitly excluded from assessment:"
→ List Tier 4 items for confirmation

**4. Decision Rules:**
"For edge cases, how should we decide?"

Examples:
- Advanced topics: "Assess if foundational, skip if specialized?"
- Applications: "Only assessed if explicitly covered?"
- Prerequisites: "Assume students know [what]?"

#### Documentation Format

```markdown
## SCOPE BOUNDARIES (FINAL)

### IN SCOPE - Confirmed for Assessment

**TIER 1 (Essential - Comprehensive Assessment):**
✅ [Topic A]: Multiple questions, various depths
✅ [Topic B]: Multiple questions, various depths
✅ [Topic C]: Multiple questions, various depths

**TIER 2 (Important - Moderate Assessment):**
✅ [Topic D]: Basic understanding level, 1-2 questions
✅ [Topic E]: Recognition level, 1 question

**Rationale:** [Why these included]

### CONDITIONAL - Context-Dependent

⚠️ [Topic F]: Include IF connecting to [Tier 1 concept]
⚠️ [Topic G]: Include IF using examples from instruction

**Conditions:** [Specific criteria]

### OUT OF SCOPE - Explicitly Excluded

❌ [Topic X]: [Reason - mentioned but skipped]
❌ [Topic Y]: [Reason - beyond course level]
❌ [Topic Z]: [Reason - different course component]

**Rationale:** [Why excluded]

### DECISION RULES

- **Advanced topics:** [Guideline]
- **Applications:** [Guideline]
- **Prerequisites:** Assume students know: [List]
- **Edge cases:** [How to handle]
```

### PART B: LEARNING OBJECTIVES SYNTHESIS (30-40 minutes)

#### FOR CLAUDE: Synthesis Strategy

**Process:**
1. Integrate all dialogue data from Stages 0-5
2. Draft learning objectives from content architecture
3. Present to teacher for validation
4. Refine based on feedback

**Integration Logic:**

**From Tier 1 content:**
- Create 2-4 objectives per major concept
- Higher cognitive levels for complex concepts
- Multiple objectives capture different aspects

**From Tier 2 content:**
- Create 1-2 objectives per concept
- May combine related concepts
- Generally lower cognitive levels

**From Tier 3 content:**
- Combine into broader objectives OR
- Skip if background only

**From examples catalog:**
- Ensure objectives can be demonstrated via available examples
- Reference examples in objective evidence

**From misconception registry:**
- Ensure objectives address understanding, not just recall
- Frame objectives to counter misconceptions

**From scope boundaries:**
- Exclude Tier 4 content completely
- Respect IN/CONDITIONAL/OUT decisions

**Bloom's Taxonomy Application:**

- **Remember:** Recall facts, terms, concepts
  - Verbs: Define, list, state, identify, name, recognize
  
- **Understand:** Explain concepts, describe processes
  - Verbs: Explain, describe, summarize, compare, classify, discuss
  
- **Apply:** Use knowledge in new situations
  - Verbs: Apply, demonstrate, use, solve, calculate, implement
  
- **Analyze:** Break down, examine relationships
  - Verbs: Analyze, differentiate, distinguish, examine, compare
  
- **Evaluate:** Make judgments, justify decisions
  - Verbs: Evaluate, assess, critique, judge, justify, argue

#### Bloom's Level Decision Guide

**When uncertain between levels:**

**Remember vs. Understand:**
- Remember: Can they recall/recognize without explanation? → Remember
- Understand: Must they explain WHY or HOW? → Understand

**Understand vs. Apply:**
- Understand: Explaining a concept in their own words → Understand
- Apply: Using the concept in a NEW scenario → Apply

**Apply vs. Analyze:**
- Apply: Using a procedure/method in a situation → Apply
- Analyze: Breaking down relationships, comparing/contrasting → Analyze

**Analyze vs. Evaluate:**
- Analyze: Examining components and relationships → Analyze
- Evaluate: Making judgments with justification → Evaluate

**Default to lower level when uncertain** - easier to assess validly.

---

#### Objective Count Guidelines

**Target Ranges:**
- Total objectives: 15-30 (depending on course scope)
- Tier 1: 10-20 objectives (majority of assessment)
- Tier 2: 3-8 objectives (supplementary assessment)
- Tier 3: 0-2 objectives (background, if included)

**Quality over Quantity:**
- Better to have 15 well-crafted objectives than 40 vague ones
- Each objective should be specific, measurable, and evidence-based
- Combine related learning goals rather than splitting unnecessarily

**Red Flags:**
- <10 total objectives: Probably too few, missing important learning goals
- >40 total objectives: Too many, likely splitting hairs or including background content

#### Draft Presentation Format

```markdown
## DRAFT LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Total: [N] objectives across all topics

Based on comprehensive analysis of your instruction, here are proposed 
learning objectives:

---

### [TIER 1 TOPIC A] ([N] objectives)

**LO1 (Remember):** [Specific action verb] [content]
- Evidence: [Connection to instruction - lectures, emphasis, time]
- Key example: [Example from catalog that demonstrates this]
- Addresses: [Misconception if applicable]

**LO2 (Understand):** [Specific action verb] [content]
- Evidence: [Connection to instructional patterns]
- Key example: [Example reference]
- Addresses: [Misconception if applicable]

**LO3 (Apply):** [Specific action verb] [content]
- Evidence: [Connection to demonstrations/activities]
- Key example: [Example reference]

---

### [TIER 1 TOPIC B] ([N] objectives)

**LO4 (Understand):** [Objective text]
- [Evidence structure]

[Continue for all topics...]

---

### SUMMARY STATISTICS

**Total Objectives:** [N]

**By Bloom's Level:**
- Remember: [N] objectives ([X]%)
- Understand: [N] objectives ([X]%)
- Apply: [N] objectives ([X]%)
- Analyze: [N] objectives ([X]%)
- Evaluate: [N] objectives ([X]%)

**By Priority Tier:**
- Tier 1: [N] objectives
- Tier 2: [N] objectives
- Tier 3: [N] objectives

---

**VALIDATION QUESTIONS:**

1. Do these objectives accurately represent what you taught?
2. Are any critical learning goals missing?
3. Should any objectives be removed, combined, or split?
4. Are Bloom's levels appropriate?
5. Is wording precise and measurable?
6. Do they reflect actual instruction (not aspirational goals)?
```

#### Validation Dialogue

**Systematic Presentation Strategy:**

1. **Present by topic** (not by Bloom's level) - keeps context clear
2. **Show all objectives for a topic together** - teacher sees complete picture
3. **Highlight evidence and examples** for each objective
4. **After each topic, pause for feedback** before moving to next
5. **Take notes on requested changes** but don't interrupt flow
6. **After all topics presented, go back and make revisions**

This prevents fragmentation and allows teacher to see the complete learning story for each topic before commenting.

---

**Presenting:**
- Present all objectives systematically
- Highlight connections to their teaching
- Reference specific evidence (lectures, examples, time)

**Common Issues & Solutions:**

🚩 **"Objective too broad"**
→ "Should I split this into [Specific A] and [Specific B]?"

🚩 **"Objective too narrow"**
→ "Should I combine this with [Related objective]?"

🚩 **"Wrong Bloom's level"**
→ "You're right. This is [level], not [claimed level]. What's the correct verb?"

🚩 **"Missing objective"**
→ "Good catch. What should the objective say? Which tier?"

🚩 **"Wording unclear"**
→ "How should I phrase it more precisely?"

**Refinement Process:**
1. Teacher provides feedback
2. Claude revises immediately
3. Present revised version
4. Confirm changes acceptable
5. Repeat until validated

---

### FOR TEACHERS: Validation Guide

**What We're Doing:**
Claude presents learning objectives synthesized from all our conversations. You validate that they accurately represent your teaching.

**What to Look For:**

✅ **Accuracy:**
Does each objective reflect what you actually taught?

✅ **Completeness:**
Are all major learning goals captured?

✅ **Specificity:**
Is the wording precise and measurable?

✅ **Appropriate Level:**
Is the cognitive level (Remember/Understand/Apply) appropriate?

**Common Feedback:**

"Objective 3 is too broad—split it into X and Y"
"Combine objectives 7 and 8—they're really the same thing"
"Objective 12 is 'Analyze' level, not 'Understand'"
"Missing: students should be able to [X]"
"Remove objective 15—we didn't cover that deeply enough"

**About Bloom's Levels:**

Don't worry about memorizing taxonomy. Just answer:
- "Is this about recalling facts or explaining concepts?"
- "Do students need to apply it or analyze it?"

Claude will suggest the correct level.

**Perfection Not Required:**

We can iterate. First pass might have issues—that's normal. 
We'll refine until they're right.
