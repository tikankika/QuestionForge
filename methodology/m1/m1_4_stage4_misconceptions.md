## STAGE 4: MISCONCEPTION REGISTRY

**Duration:** 20-30 minutes  
**Nature:** Systematic inquiry about student errors  
**Purpose:** Document common misconceptions for distractor development

---

### FOR CLAUDE: Misconception Documentation Strategy

#### Context

Stage 4 builds on Stage 0's initial misconception identification. During material analysis, Claude noted common student errors that were addressed in instruction. Stage 4 systematically expands these preliminary notes through dialogue.

At this point:
- Stage 0 identified misconceptions addressed in materials (preliminary, incomplete)
- Stage 2 discussed student struggles with emphasis topics
- Stage 4 comprehensively documents ALL common misconceptions

This stage focuses on cataloging misconceptions for distractor development in BB4 (creating realistic wrong answers in multiple-choice questions).

---

#### Opening Context

```
Every concept has typical ways students misunderstand it initially. 
I want to document the common misconceptions you encountered—the errors 
that kept coming up, that you had to correct repeatedly. These will help 
create realistic wrong answers (distractors) in multiple-choice questions.
```

#### Topic Progression Strategy

Work through content systematically:

1. **Start with Stage 0's misconception list** as reference (don't start from scratch)
2. **Work through Tier 1 concepts** in order (chronological from Stage 0)
3. **For each concept, ask all 5 inquiry areas** (Common Errors, Confused Concepts, Oversimplifications, Persistent Errors, Surprising Errors)
4. **After Tier 1 complete**, briefly address Tier 2 misconceptions if significant
5. **Skip Tier 3/4 misconceptions** (background only, not for assessment)

Refer to Stage 0's preliminary list to prompt teacher memory, then expand with dialogue.

---

#### Systematic Inquiry

For each major concept:

**1. Common Errors:**
"For [Concept A], what's the most common mistake students make?"

*Follow-ups:*
- "Why do they make this error?"
- "What's the underlying confusion?"
- "How did you correct it?"

**2. Confused Concepts:**
"Do students confuse [Concept B] with something else?"

*Follow-ups:*
- "What do they confuse it with?"
- "Why is this confusion common?"
- "How do you distinguish them?"

**3. Oversimplifications:**
"Do students oversimplify [Complex Concept C]?"

*Follow-ups:*
- "What nuance do they miss?"
- "What's the simpler (wrong) version they believe?"
- "What helps them see the complexity?"

**4. Persistent Errors:**
"Were there misconceptions that persisted even after correction?"

*Follow-ups:*
- "Why was this hard to correct?"
- "What made it stick?"
- "Did any approach help?"

**5. Surprising Errors:**
"Did students make any unexpected mistakes you didn't anticipate?"

*Follow-ups:*
- "What was surprising about it?"
- "How common was this error?"
- "Where did it come from?"

#### Misconception Selection Criteria

**Focus on Systematic Errors:**
- Document RECURRING misconceptions (not one-off mistakes)
- Include errors that MANY students made (not individual confusion)
- Prioritize misconceptions that PERSIST (hard to correct)

**Quantity Guidelines:**
- Tier 1 concepts: 2-3 misconceptions each (if present)
- Tier 2 concepts: 1-2 misconceptions each (if present)
- Total target: 8-15 misconceptions across all topics (not exhaustive)

Don't document every error mentioned—focus on systematic, common, persistent mistakes.

#### Registry Format

Document with structure:

```markdown
## MISCONCEPTION REGISTRY

### [Concept/Topic]

**Misconception 1: [Student Error Pattern]**
- Incorrect thinking: [What students believe/do]
- Why wrong: [Correction/clarification]
- Root cause: [Why this error is common]
- How addressed: [Teaching strategy used]
- Persistence: [Easy to correct / Persistent / Very stubborn]
- Severity: ⚠️⚠️⚠️ High / ⚠️⚠️ Medium / ⚠️ Low

**Misconception 2: [Student Error Pattern]**
- [Similar structure]

[Continue for all major misconceptions]
```

#### Severity Rating Guide

**⚠️⚠️⚠️ High Severity:**
- Fundamental misunderstanding
- Common (most students make this error)
- Persistent (hard to correct)
- Undermines further learning

**⚠️⚠️ Medium Severity:**
- Significant error
- Moderately common (many students)
- Correctable with explanation
- Doesn't block further progress

**⚠️ Low Severity:**
- Minor confusion
- Uncommon (few students)
- Easily corrected
- Limited impact

#### Probing Strategies

**When teacher identifies misconception:**
→ "How common was this error?"
→ "What made it hard for students to let go of?"
→ "What finally helped them understand correctly?"

**When teacher says "they got it wrong":**
→ "What specifically did they think?"
→ "Was it random error or systematic misunderstanding?"

**When teacher describes correction:**
→ "Did that work? Did they stop making the error?"
→ "What percentage of students had this misconception?"

#### Documentation Focus

Capture:
- [ ] Specific error pattern (not just "wrong")
- [ ] Incorrect reasoning (what they believe)
- [ ] Correct understanding (clarification)
- [ ] How common (most/many/some/few students)
- [ ] How persistent (easy/moderate/hard to correct)
- [ ] Teaching strategy that worked

**Where to Document:**
Create Misconception Registry document (part of BB1 output package). This registry will be referenced in Stage 5 learning objectives and used in BB4 for distractor development.

### FOR TEACHERS: How to Document Misconceptions

**What We're Doing:**
Identifying the typical ways students misunderstand concepts—the errors that keep coming up.

**Why This Matters:**
These misconceptions become realistic wrong answers (distractors) in multiple-choice questions. If we know what students actually think when confused, we create better questions.

**Most Helpful:**

✅ **Specific error patterns:**
"Students think biogenic CO2 means biofuels are completely carbon-neutral, missing that production still emits."

✅ **Frequency notes:**
"Almost everyone makes this error initially."

✅ **Root cause:**
"They oversimplify the carbon cycle—they see the loop but miss the inputs."

✅ **What worked:**
"Drawing the full lifecycle with all emission points helped."

✅ **Persistence:**
"Even after explanation, about 30% still struggled with this on the next example."

**Note:** This example is from an environmental science course. Your misconceptions will reflect your subject area (e.g., "mitosis is cell division to make gametes" in biology, "negative times negative is negative" in mathematics, "the Civil War was only about slavery" in history, etc.).

**Less Helpful:**

❌ **"They just got it wrong"** (what specifically did they think?)
❌ **"Some errors occurred"** (what errors? how common?)
❌ **Blame statements** ("they didn't study enough")

**Common Patterns:**

Students often:
- Oversimplify complex concepts
- Confuse similar-sounding terms
- Apply incorrect reasoning from familiar contexts
- Miss nuance and see things as binary
- Overgeneralize from specific examples

**When You Can't Recall Exact Errors:**
That's OK! General patterns help:
- "They struggled with the distinction between X and Y"
- "There was confusion about when to include Z"
- "Many missed the complexity of the issue"

## STAGE 4 COMPLETION CHECKPOINT

**When Stage 4 misconception analysis is complete:**

### CRITICAL: STOP HERE

**DO NOT PROCEED AUTOMATICALLY TO STAGE 5**

### Required Actions:
1. **PRESENT** the misconception registry to the teacher
2. **CONFIRM** no major misconceptions were missed
3. **STOP and WAIT** for teacher approval to proceed

### Stage 5 Requirements:
Before proceeding to Stage 5, you MUST have:
- ✅ bb1g (Stage5_Scope_Objectives.md) instructions loaded
- ✅ Teacher has reviewed misconception registry
- ✅ Teacher explicitly says: "Start Stage 5" or "Proceed to scope boundaries and learning objectives"
- ✅ Misconception registry documented and saved

### DO NOT:
- ❌ Start Stage 5 dialogue without teacher approval
- ❌ Proceed without bb1g instructions loaded
- ❌ Improvise scope boundary or learning objective questions
- ❌ Assume registry is complete without confirmation
- ❌ Skip the explicit approval step

### Transition Statement:
"Stage 4 misconception analysis is now complete. I have documented the common student errors above:
- [N] High severity misconceptions (fundamental, common, persistent)
- [N] Medium severity misconceptions (significant, correctable)
- [N] Low severity misconceptions (minor, uncommon)
- Total: [N] misconceptions documented

To proceed to Stage 5 (Scope Boundaries & Learning Objectives), I need:
1. Your confirmation that no major misconceptions were missed
2. Explicit instruction to proceed
3. bb1g file loaded (Stage 5 instructions)

Please review the misconception registry and let me know when you're ready to start Stage 5."
