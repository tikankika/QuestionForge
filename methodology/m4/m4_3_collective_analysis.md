# BUILDING BLOCK 5d: PHASE 3 - COLLECTIVE ASSESSMENT ANALYSIS

**Component:** Building Block 5d  
**Framework:** Modular Question Generation System  
**Phase:** Phase 3 - Collective Assessment Analysis  
**Classification:** 🔶 EXPERT JUDGMENT  
**Duration:** ~15-20 minutes  
**Primary Input:** Individually approved questions from Phase 2  
**Primary Output:** Collective validation report

---

## PURPOSE

Evaluate complete question set as coherent assessment instrument. Individual question quality does not guarantee collective assessment quality. This phase examines coverage completeness, distribution balance, consistency across questions, and overall assessment character.

---

## VALIDATION DIMENSIONS

### Coverage Validation

**Minimum Coverage Requirements:**
- Every learning objective has minimum coverage (≥2 questions)
- Tier 1 (essential) objectives adequately covered
- Tier 2 (important) objectives represented
- No systematic gaps in content domains

**Coverage Analysis:**

**By Learning Objective:**
```
Learning Objective ID | Tier | Questions | Status
LO-Bio-Cell-01       | 1    | 4         | ✅ Adequate
LO-Bio-Cell-02       | 1    | 2         | ✅ Minimum
LO-Bio-Cell-03       | 2    | 0         | ❌ Missing
```

**Coverage Quality:**
- Are essential concepts covered adequately?
- Do coverage levels reflect objective importance?
- Are there unexplained gaps?

**Gap Identification:**
- Missing objectives identified
- Severity assessed (Tier 1 gaps critical)
- Additional generation needs specified

### Distribution Validation

#### Bloom's Cognitive Levels

**Blueprint vs. Actual Comparison:**
```
Bloom's Level  | Blueprint | Actual | Variance | Status
Remember       | 15%       | 13%    | -2%      | ✅ Within tolerance
Understand     | 30%       | 35%    | +5%      | ⚠️ At tolerance
Apply          | 35%       | 32%    | -3%      | ✅ Within tolerance
Analyze        | 15%       | 15%    | 0%       | ✅ Match
Evaluate       | 5%        | 5%     | 0%       | ✅ Match
```

**Tolerance:** ±5% acceptable for distributions

**Distribution Quality:**
- Does cognitive emphasis match instructional intent?
- Are higher-order questions present as planned?
- Is lower-order knowledge assessed appropriately?

**Imbalance Handling:**
- Minor variances (≤5%): Note but accept
- Moderate variances (6-10%): Consider adjustment
- Major variances (>10%): Require correction

#### Question Types

**Blueprint vs. Actual:**
```
Question Type      | Blueprint | Actual | Variance | Status
Multiple Choice    | 50%       | 55%    | +5%      | ✅ Within tolerance
Multiple Response  | 15%       | 10%    | -5%      | ✅ Within tolerance
Short Answer       | 20%       | 20%    | 0%       | ✅ Match
Essay              | 15%       | 15%    | 0%       | ✅ Match
```

**Format Variety:**
- Adequate construct representation?
- Format matches objective assessment needs?
- No over-reliance on single format?

#### Difficulty Levels

**Blueprint vs. Actual:**
```
Difficulty | Blueprint | Actual | Variance | Status
Easy       | 30%       | 28%    | -2%      | ✅ Within tolerance
Medium     | 50%       | 54%    | +4%      | ✅ Within tolerance
Hard       | 20%       | 18%    | -2%      | ✅ Within tolerance
```

**Difficulty Profile:**
- Appropriate challenge distribution?
- Avoids floor effects (too many hard)?
- Avoids ceiling effects (too many easy)?
- Matches assessment purpose?

### Consistency Checks

#### Terminology Consistency

**Cross-Question Review:**
- Same concepts use consistent terminology
- No conflicting definitions
- Abbreviations used consistently
- Technical terms defined equivalently

**Common Issues:**
- "cell membrane" vs "plasma membrane" used inconsistently
- Abbreviations undefined in some questions
- Varying precision in terminology
- Discipline-specific term variations

#### Question Independence

**Dependency Detection:**
- No question reveals answer to another
- No required sequential answering
- No cumulative point allocations creating dependencies

**Problematic Patterns:**
- Question 2 contains answer to Question 1
- Multi-part questions with inappropriate dependencies
- Scenario reuse creating unintended cues

#### Redundancy Assessment

**Appropriate vs. Excessive:**
- **Appropriate:** Multiple questions on same objective with different scenarios
- **Excessive:** Near-identical questions with superficial variations

**Red Flags:**
- Same scenario repeated unnecessarily
- Questions differ only in wording, not substance
- Coverage maintained through duplication rather than variety

#### Point Allocation

**Proportionality Check:**
- Points reflect relative difficulty
- Points align with cognitive demand
- Points proportional to objective importance
- Total points reasonable for assessment purpose

**Point Distribution:**
```
Difficulty | Typical Points | Cognitive Level Adjustments
Easy       | 1-2 points     | Remember/Understand
Medium     | 2-4 points     | Apply/Analyze
Hard       | 4-6 points     | Analyze/Evaluate/Create
```

### Assessment Character

#### Purpose Alignment

**Formative Assessment Character:**
- Adequate low-stakes question distribution
- Diagnostic value present
- Feedback supports learning
- Appropriate difficulty for learning stage

**Summative Assessment Character:**
- Adequate challenge for evaluation
- Comprehensive coverage
- Appropriate difficulty distribution
- Reliable discrimination expected

#### Cognitive Emphasis

**Assessment Profile:**
- Matches instructional emphasis?
- Appropriate for course level?
- Balanced or intentionally focused?

**Profile Analysis:**
- Introductory course: Heavier Remember/Understand/Apply
- Advanced course: More Apply/Analyze/Evaluate
- Capstone: Significant Analyze/Evaluate/Create

#### Time Requirements

**Completion Time Estimation:**
```
Question Type      | Average Time | Questions | Total
Multiple Choice    | 1.5 min      | 22        | 33 min
Multiple Response  | 2 min        | 4         | 8 min
Short Answer       | 3 min        | 8         | 24 min
Essay              | 10 min       | 2         | 20 min
                                   TOTAL:      85 min
```

**Time Appropriateness:**
- Matches scheduled assessment time?
- Allows sufficient thinking time?
- Reasonable pacing expected?
- Buffer time for review included?

- Distributions validated (within tolerance)
- Consistency confirmed
- Assessment character appropriate
- Ready to proceed to Phase 4

**ADJUSTMENTS:**
- Minor coverage gaps (Tier 2-3 objectives)
- Small distribution variances (within 5-8%)
- Minor point reallocation needed
- Simple corrections possible within BB5

**ADDITIONAL GENERATION:**
- Coverage gaps in Tier 1 objectives
- Distribution imbalances (>10%)
- Format variety insufficient
- Return to BB4 for targeted generation

**MAJOR REVISION:**
- Systematic coverage problems
- Fundamental distribution mismatches
- Assessment character inappropriate
- Requires BB4 regeneration with blueprint review

## ADJUSTMENT STRATEGIES

### Minor Coverage Adjustments

**Options:**
1. Accept reduced coverage for lower-tier objectives
2. Repurpose existing questions to address gaps
3. Generate 1-2 targeted questions

### Distribution Rebalancing

**Approaches:**
1. Remove questions creating imbalance
2. Adjust question metadata (if authentic)
3. Generate targeted questions for underrepresented areas
4. Accept minor variances with documentation

### Consistency Corrections

**Simple Fixes:**
- Update terminology for consistency
- Revise point allocations
- Adjust question sequencing
- Edit feedback for alignment

## PHASE 3 COMPLETION CHECKPOINT

✅ **This phase is now complete.**

**REQUIRED ACTIONS:**
1. Review collective analysis results
2. Determine status (PASS/ADJUSTMENTS/ADDITIONAL/REVISION)
3. Document required adjustments or additional generation
4. Obtain instructor approval for collective status
5. WAIT for explicit instruction to proceed to Phase 4

**Teacher must explicitly say:** "Proceed to Phase 4" or "Start quality documentation"

**DO NOT proceed automatically to Phase 4.**
