## STAGE 2: EMPHASIS REFINEMENT

**Duration:** 30-45 minutes  
**Nature:** Dynamic dialogue with adaptive inquiry  
**Purpose:** Refine understanding of content priorities and rationale

---

### FOR CLAUDE: Dialogue Facilitation Strategy

#### Context

Stage 2 builds on Stage 1's validated priority structure. At this point:
- Tier 1-4 content architecture is confirmed accurate
- Major topics are correctly prioritized
- Time allocations are roughly validated

Stage 2 refines this understanding by exploring WHY these priorities exist, HOW content was taught, and WHAT students need to demonstrate.

---

#### Opening Move

Present Stage 1 validated structure and transition to deeper inquiry:

```
Now that we've confirmed the priority structure, I want to understand 
the nuances—what made certain topics especially important, where students 
struggled, what examples worked best. This will help me create better 
learning objectives.

Let's start with your Tier 1 content...
```

#### Topic Progression Strategy

Work through content systematically:

1. **Start with the FIRST Tier 1 topic** (chronological order from Stage 0 analysis)
2. **Complete all 4 inquiry areas** (Time, Pedagogy, Challenges, Assessment) for that topic
3. **Move to next Tier 1 topic** and repeat
4. **After all Tier 1 topics covered**, briefly address Tier 2 if time permits
5. **Do NOT spend Stage 2 time on Tier 3/4** (background only, out of assessment scope)

This ensures comprehensive coverage of essential content before addressing lower-priority topics.

---

#### Systematic Inquiry Framework

These are **starting point questions**—adapt based on responses!

**1. Time Allocation & Emphasis**

*Initial question:*
"Looking at [Tier 1 Topic A], I estimated about [N] minutes total coverage. 
Is that roughly accurate? What made this topic need so much time?"

*Adaptive follow-ups:*
- If teacher corrects time: "Got it, [corrected time]. Why was it shorter/longer than I thought?"
- If teacher explains difficulty: "What specifically was challenging for students?"
- If teacher mentions multiple approaches: "Which approach worked best?"

**2. Pedagogical Decisions**

*Initial question:*
"You used [Example X, Y, Z] for [Topic B]. What made you choose those particular examples?"

*Adaptive follow-ups:*
- If mentions student response: "How did students react?"
- If mentions success: "What made that example click?"
- If mentions failure: "What would you do differently?"

**3. Student Learning Challenges**

*Initial question:*
"Were there any topics where students consistently struggled or had misconceptions?"

*Adaptive follow-ups:*
- If mentions struggle: "What was the root of the confusion?"
- If mentions multiple struggles: "Which was the biggest challenge?"
- If mentions breakthrough: "What helped them finally understand?"

**4. Assessment Priorities**

*Initial question:*
"When you think about assessing [Topic C], what's the key thing students need to demonstrate?"

*Adaptive follow-ups:*
- If answer is broad: "Can you be more specific?"
- If mentions skills: "Is this about recall, application, or analysis?"
- If mentions depth: "Should they explain it or just recognize it?"

#### Probing Strategies

**When teacher gives brief/vague answer:**
→ "Can you tell me more about that?"
→ "What's a specific instance of that?"
→ "Can you give me an example?"

**When teacher mentions interesting detail:**
→ "That's interesting—can we explore that more?"
→ "How does that connect to [related topic]?"
→ "Did that surprise you?"

**When teacher says "everything matters":**
→ "I understand. But if you were creating a 20-question quiz, what would be the 5 MUST-KNOW items?"
→ "What would a strong student absolutely need to master?"

**When teacher goes off-topic:**
→ Gently redirect: "That's useful context. Bringing it back to [original question]..."
→ But also: Let interesting tangents play out briefly—they often reveal implicit priorities

#### Red Flags & Solutions

🚩 **"Just follow the syllabus/textbook"**
→ "I understand those guided your teaching. But in practice, what did you actually emphasize when you taught?"

🚩 **Everything marked Tier 1**
→ "Let's think about it differently: if students only had time to study 3 topics for 2 hours, which topics would give them the best foundation?"

🚩 **Curriculum listing instead of teaching description**
→ "I see what the plan was. But when you actually taught it, where did you spend more time? What did students engage with?"

🚩 **Focus on what students should know vs. what was taught**
→ "That's aspirational—important for curriculum. But for assessment, I need to know what you actually covered in depth."

#### Documentation Focus

Capture in running notes:
- [ ] Rationale for emphasis decisions (why Tier 1 topics matter most)
- [ ] Time allocation corrections (more accurate estimates)
- [ ] Pedagogical approaches (how topics were taught)
- [ ] Student response patterns (where struggle or success)
- [ ] Assessment focus guidance (what to test, how deeply)
- [ ] Connections between topics (conceptual relationships)

**Where to Document:**
Record these insights in Stage 2 refinement notes (part of BB1 working documentation). These will be synthesized into final learning objectives in Stage 5.

### FOR TEACHERS: Participation Guide

**What We're Doing:**
Going deeper into why certain content matters most, how you taught it, and what students need to demonstrate.

**This Isn't:**
- ❌ A performance review of your teaching
- ❌ A curriculum compliance check
- ❌ A test of your memory

**This Is:**
- ✅ A conversation about your pedagogical decisions
- ✅ Documentation of your expertise
- ✅ Foundation for better assessment

**Most Helpful Responses:**

✅ **Pedagogical rationale:**
"I emphasized X because students need it for Y, and without X they always struggle with Z."

✅ **Teaching stories:**
"When I taught this, students really clicked with the [example] because it showed [why it works]."

✅ **Honest struggles:**
"Topic X was hard—I spent extra time because students kept confusing it with Y."

✅ **Assessment priorities:**
"For this topic, the key thing is understanding WHY, not just memorizing WHAT."

✅ **Specific examples:**
"The lifecycle comparison example—I spent 15 minutes on it and came back to it in three later lectures."

**Less Helpful Responses:**

❌ **Vague generalities:**
"Everything is important" / "It's all in the textbook"

❌ **Aspirational goals:**
"Students should be able to..." (vs. what you actually taught and they engaged with)

❌ **Defensive justifications:**
"I had to cover this because..." (just describe what happened, not defend it)

**Types of Questions You'll Hear:**

*About time:* "How long did you spend on...?"
*About emphasis:* "What made this especially important?"
*About pedagogy:* "Which examples worked best?"
*About students:* "Where did students struggle?"
*About assessment:* "What should students be able to demonstrate?"

**When Uncertain:**
- "I'm not sure exactly, but I think..."
- "Let me think... probably about [estimate]"
- "That's a good question. My sense is..."

Remember: Rough estimates and general impressions are fine. Dialogue helps refine them.

#### Example Dialogue Flow

**Claude:** "Looking at the allocation problem in lifecycle assessment—you spent about 20 minutes on it in Lecture 1b and came back to it in the summary. What made this so important?"

**Teacher:** "Students always want ONE correct answer for emissions calculations, but with multi-product refineries there isn't one. It's conceptually challenging."

**Claude:** "So the key learning isn't the calculation itself, but understanding why uncertainty exists?"

**Teacher:** "Exactly. The methods are less important than grasping that the choice affects results."

**Claude:** "Got it. When assessing this, should questions focus on: explaining why allocation creates uncertainty, comparing different methods, or doing calculations?"

**Teacher:** "Definitely explaining the uncertainty. Maybe some method comparison, but not detailed calculations."

**Claude:** "Perfect. So assessment should be conceptual, not computational. That helps me frame the learning objective correctly."

**Note:** This example is from an environmental science course. Adapt the dialogue pattern to your subject area (e.g., biology, mathematics, history, etc.).
